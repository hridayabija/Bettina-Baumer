## An Introduction to Kaśmīr Śaivism

**Most respected Śrī Śāntakumārjī, dear Ajit, dear Vidyā, dear Praveen, and uh, dear students and friends.**

It is a tradition in all of the spiritual uh schools or traditions of India, and maybe outside, to start any retreat, spiritual teaching, or even writing or reading of a spiritual text with two elements.

### Saṅkalpa: Setting an Intention

One is **saṅkalpa**. Saṅkalpa means you make a resolve; you express an intention. *What is the purpose we have come here together, and what is the goal uh we want to achieve?* 

So **saṅkalpa**, of course, in ritual, in pūjā, it is very extensive and elaborated, and it places you in the whole cosmic context of space and time. You are now in this *kalpa*, in this *yuga*, and this uh year, and this place, in *this* particular place. It’s very uh important because you have to place yourself in space and time, and in this particular, you connect yourself with the cosmic space and time, and then you go to your personal being in this space and time. So that is part of **saṅkalpa**.

And of course, in a spiritual teaching like ours, our **saṅkalpa** is very simple, but not easy. Our **saṅkalpa** is nothing less than **enlightenment**. And that is why the first um śloka which we have recited is all about **enlightenment**. 

> And it is so universal; it can apply to any tradition. See, when the sun of ultimate reality illuminates, all darkness of ignorance gets destroyed. Then the wise ones of pure vision do not see the world of confusing multiplicity even to the smallest measure.

And this, of course, in its brevity, it hints at **sudden enlightenment**. It doesn’t tell you, “Now you have to do all these practices, and you have to do this yoga and that uh philosophy,” and so on. *When the sun of ultimate reality shines upon you, then suddenly that transformation happens.* So this is our **saṅkalpa**: it is nothing less than that.

And of course in yoga also, we call it **lakṣya**. You perform uh yoga, particular forms of yoga, with a **lakṣya**, with a purpose, with an aim, with a goal. So one should never start any such spiritual exercise, retreats, or spiritual teaching without having that aim in mind, and without focusing on that aim.

### Maṅgala: Invoking Auspiciousness

And the second element, which is very necessary in all the uh Indian traditions, especially those which have, of course, Sanskrit uh at as a basis, is called **maṅgala**. Now **maṅgala** means just auspiciousness, but then we have **maṅgala ślokas**. These are verses which express a benediction, which invoke the divine or the guru, and which uh give an auspicious beginning to any spiritual enterprise. 

And the Kaśmīra Śaiva authors have given a lot of import importance to to this **maṅgala** uh verses, and have expressed a very rich, even philosophy, through these very condensed verses. So you will learn a lot of this uh in a particular context of a particular text. And we will also learn to recite it and all that. So **maṅgala** has many uh purposes. 

And apart from invoking the blessings of the divine, of the guru, and to remove the obstacles. Because we know very well when we have any spiritual uh undertaking, there are always obstacles. Whether you have a problem, you fall sick, or you have a problem with travel, or anything. So there is a saying which our great master Abhinavagupta repeats: *śrīyām̐si bahu-vidhāni*. **In any auspicious, in any uh spiritual undertaking, a lot of obstacles.** And it’s of course a test always to overcome, overcome these obstacles, and to be strong enough to fulfill one’s uh purpose.

And I have also called these ślokas, which you are going to learn a lot of them. *Don’t worry*. Nothing without translation. You will have the Sanskrit, but translation will always be there. I have also called them **“philosophy in a nutshell.”** Because uh in one verse, they condense sometimes the whole philosophy which we be be expanded afterwards in the text which follows. So they are really a kind of introduction to Kaśmīr Śaivism itself. If you read all these ślokas and uh meditate on them – the purpose is of course to meditate on that – then you have a wonderful entrance, an introduction, to Kaśmīr Śaivism.

###  From Information to Transformation

Now uh, it is a matter of experience in these uh retreat seminars – I always call them retreat seminars because the two elements are equally strong, meaning the spiritual element and also the element of learning, of study – it is a matter of experience that the first day is always a day of orientation, of getting into the subject matter, and of, I would call it, information. But from the second day, the same topic has to lead to **transformation**. Because a spiritual retreat cannot be without any **transformation**. So today we’ll have that kind of information uh, a little bit of background information, because maybe, maybe many of you are not so familiar with Kaśmīr Śaivism. And from tomorrow, we enter really deeply into the transformative aspect of uh retreat.

## The Uniqueness of Kaśmīr Śaivism

Now it is not an easy task to to give an introduction to Kaśmīr Śaivism in half an hour. But I will at least give you some elements which then will be developed, of course, in the course of the uh the coming days. 

Now it is uh what we call commonly Kaśmīr Śaivism. Of course, it’s a bit of a misnomer uh, but it is a such a uh rich and profound spiritual and philosophical tradition, and it is much less known in India itself. And whatever historical reasons there are uh, like for example, in many universities, philosophy departments, it is not taught. And it’s one of the greatest uh philosophies India has ever produced. And just by the way, when people say, “Oh, there are only six systems of philosophy. So what about Kaśmīr Śaivism?” There are not only six. There was an author in South India in the 14th century, Madhavā, and he wrote *Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha*, a summary of all the *darśanas*. And they are 16. And among those 16, Kaśmīr Śaivism or **Pratyabhijñā**, the system of recogni- recognition, has a very high place. So we should not uh consider that the system has not been recognized outside Kaśmīr. Not at all. Kaśmīr is just the place of origin. 

And Kaśmīr has been such a tremendous uh fountainhead of so many traditions: spiritual, religious, philosophical… Of course, so much of Buddhism uh uh was in Kaśmīr. We still have the ruins of Harwan and all those monasteries. And literature, aesthetics, and so many uh Sanskrit texts which have come from Kaśmīr and have then been spread all over uh the cont- the subcontinent. So there also, the the so-called Kaśmīr Śaivism, it has been spread. 

And this is something very interesting also for politicians. When we are dealing with the **unity of the Indian culture**, it was a **spiritual unity**. And those uh the authors like Abhinavagupta, the the texts like the Tantras and the other texts, they travel from Śrīnagar to Kerala, to Tamil Nadu, and to all of the other parts of India. At the time there was no internet; there was no, there were no airlines. It’s incredible how this uh tradition has been uh spread and has created a, a a unity of uh the Indian subcontinent spiritually and culturally. 

And one uh very typical example is that the great Abhinavagupta, in the 10th, 11th century CE, his fame must have spread to the far south because one uh *sanyāsi*, one *sādhu* from Tamil Nadu, Madhurāja from Madurai – he came from Madurai to Śrīnagar to sit at the feet of Abhinavagupta! So it’s incredible! At the time when there was no facilities of communication. But the **spiritual power** and **attraction** was so much that you could find them. And, “There’s a great master in Śrīnagar, I have to go there! Even on foot.” So this is a great uh element. 

Of course, Buddhism is a great example of how the spiritual has spread and has brought uh people together, in spite of the difference in language. Of course, Sanskrit was a link language. And uh, those texts were of course uh spread uh and composed in Sanskrit. 

### Beyond Sectarianism: The Essence of Consciousness

Now uh, when we call this Kaśmīr Śaivism – I said Kaśmīr was the place of origin – but in no way did it remain confined to to Kaśmīr. And uh, so what, what is this specific uh contribution of Kaśmīr Śaivism, which in its two senses called **Trika**, the triadic system, or **Pratyabhijñā**, the philosophy of divine recognition? What is its specific contribution in the whole field of Indian spirituality, philosophy, etcetera? 

It is a system which combines uh a number of elements which otherwise are dealt with separately. Like yoga, Tantra, aesthetics uh, literature, philosophy… They are not in isolation, but they are very much interconnected. And everything that we have done – the yoga of Netra Tantra last year – everything gets its basis in a very **universal philosophy**. And the philosophy which is not **sectarian**. See, the name Śaivism also uh is misleading. It is not **sectarian** a- at all. You have seen the first śloka. It says just, “On the sun of great uh reality…” There’s no name, there’s no… 

And *who is Śiva*? **Śiva is called the essence of consciousness.** The essence of consciousness. So there’s nothing that… you think it is… It must be some *mūrti* and some uh sectarian, you know uh belonging, and so on. Definitely Śiva, or in his name Bhairava, is at the center of the whole tradition. But not in any limited sense. Not in any individualistic sense, but in the sense of **universal consciousness**. 

###  Svātantraya-vāda: The Way of Absolute Freedom

Now um, one very specific name of the tradition is also **Svātantraya-vāda**. So in the whole of Indian philosophy, this is the only system which is called **the way of pure, absolute freedom**. It is something which is extraordinary. And **svātantrya** is also… When we’re coming to the whole topic of the **Trika**, the central energy of Śiva is called **svātantryaśakti**. It is the energy of absolute freedom, of absolute autonomy. And when you ask any questions, you know, the **svātantrya** is the basis for the whole development of the energies and of the the whole system. So **Svātantraya-vāda** is a quite a unique name of this uh school. 

### Spanda: The Vibration of Consciousness

Another part of the whole school is **spanda**. And this is again something quite unique to this tradition. **Spanda** means **vibration**. And *vibration of what*? **Vibration of consciousness.** And it is the whole dynamic understanding, dynamic view of the universe, of the human uh being, of this microcosm-macrocosm relationship. And it is nothing static. It is the **vibrancy of consciousness**. And that is why, maybe you can uh make some connection why this tradition has also produced a lot of art, aesthetics, and the whole theory of aesthetics. Because any creativity… In the house of artists, I think among us uh, depends on the dynamic, dynamism. And you cannot have any creative uh inspiration without the dynamism. And the dynamism is based on **spanda**. **Spanda** is that **vibration of consciousness** which we can experience and which connects us with the whole universe. 

### Śivādvaita-vāda: The Non-Dualism of Śiva

So anyhow, I should not be tempted to go into one or the other of these uh aspects of the school. And it is definitely a system of non-dualism, **advaita**. **Śivādvaita**. **Śivādvaita-vāda**. It is the non-dualism of Śiva. Śaiva non-dualism. 

And, but this non-dualism… We have several systems of *advaita* in Indian philosophy uh with different, have developed different aspects. But the specific uh nature of the **Śaiva advaita** is that it is **not exclusive of anything**. That is why they called it **paramadvaita**. It is the **supreme non-dualism**. Means, that’s non-dualism between the divine and the human, between the cosmos and the human, and uh between Śiva and Śakti. And uh, there is a danger if you say, “Oh, this is *advaita* and this is *dvaita*.” Now in **paramadvaita**, it is always said, it **does not exclude duality, multiplicity**. Because we live in a world of multiplicity, in a world of beauty. And the very word for multiplicity in Sanskrit, *vaiśītrya*, also means **beauty**. So there’s nothing negative about it. And uh this multiplicity still has to be seen in the context of non-dual relationship with the divine. So this is the specific contribution of uh the *advaita* in the Śaiva context. 

### Trika: The Threefold Structure of Reality

Now I have to… Yes, we have a scheme on the uh whiteboard. **What is Trika?** See, the the original name of uh Kashmir Śaivism or **Trika**… Or there are some beautiful names also, um, something *advaita-vāda*. It is the **non-dualism of consciousness**, the system of non-duality of consciousness. But **Trika** gives you this whole structure of the system in terms of the **three metaphysical principles**: that is **Śiva** – maybe put it a little closer – **Śiva**, **Śakti**, and **nara**. 

So the whole of reality consists of the divine, his energy, and anything, and the human, or the created being. So there are, in also, in a non-dual relationship, but there is the dynamism between **Śiva** and **Śakti**. Now **Śakti** is the divine energy. It is extremely dominant in the whole system because nothing happens without the energy. 

And uh, then we have uh three principle energies of Śiva: that is **icchā**, **jñāna**, **kriyā**. With the willpower, energy of will, energy of knowledge, and energy of activity. And then there’s so many other diets uh connected. 

Now what I want to draw your attention to is um, this **threefold division of the whole of reality has its practical application in the spiritual practice.** So then we… From tomorrow we will uh go into the spirituality of these texts which I will tell you after the break. I will go more into the content of our uh retreat. 

So any spiritual practice or experience can be placed in one or the other of those levels of this **Trika**. See, there is the highest level of the highest *yogi*, or highest experience, is the divine. And that is when… *Upāya* means the means, the way. So **śāmbhavopāya** is the **divine way**, where actually it’s not the *yogi*, or the *sādhaka*, or the practitioner, who acts. **It’s Śiva who acts. It’s only Śiva who acts.** That’s why the **śāmbhava**, *śāmbhavopāya*. And it is the way of **icchāśakti**, of pure will. 

Now, “will,” not in any Western sense of uh individualistic or uh… Not at all. Will… *Icchā* means the **primordial impulse** from which everything… Whatever you do has, at its basis, uh some impulse. And that impulse has… Part is part of the divine **icchāśakti**, of the divine power of will. 

Then if your practice and experience is connected with **Śakti**, with the energy, it is both uh… All the experiences connected with **Śakti**, like *kuṇḍalinī* and so on, they belong to the **śāktopāya**, the way of the energy, which is also a way of **knowledge**. 

Now, “knowledge,” you cannot, in the dualistic sense, “knowing” something or somebody. **Knowledge in the sense of gnosis**. I often translate it as **gnosis**. Means that **mystical knowledge** or **spiritual knowledge**. And this is at the level of **śakti**, of the energy of knowledge. 

Now any experience or practice which… For which you need a body and the mind, and and this whole individual being uh which is at the level of **nara** or **aṇu**. *Aṇu*, other, means that individual. And then from that individual level, then you have to practice yoga, you have to do rituals, you have to do mantra, you have to do all kinds of things to transform that physical or mental uh being into, then, the level of energy, and then the divine level. 

###  From Individuality to Universality: The Essence of Kaśmīr Śaivism

So the question, *how to classify these uh our practices and our experiences?* It depends on the **level of consciousness**. If somebody is still… We are most of us identified with the body. *I am so-and-so, and I was born so…* And all this indivi- individual… You identify yourself with that individuality, then you have to do this **āṇavopāya**. Practice yoga, practice uh ritual, practice mantra, and all that, to move from that individual identity to the **universal**, your **universal consciousness**. That is one… **The briefest definition of Kashmir Śaivism** by my guru Swami Lakshman Joo is: **It is a movement from individuality to universality.** 

That is… We are going to do quite a lot of practices and try to understand, through those texts, how this movement goes from the individual consciousness to the universal consciousness. 

And of course, I will talk about **mātṛkā** in the second part of our introduction. **Finding the center.** **Mātṛkā is actually enlightenment.** And it is precisely that what we heard in the first *maṅgalaśloka*: that this uh son of the great supreme reality wants… That illuminates us, that there’s nothing to do, nothing more to do.

And the beauty of these three *upāyas* is also, not only that you can move from one to the other… **There is also a jump.** There is also suddenness. And this is basically… **They were believers in sudden enlightenment.** But not everybody is qualified for that. Of course, one has to be uh qualified for **sudden enlightenment**, but it is definitely the highest form.

And then when these three ways of *upā*– *upāyas*, they were… I mean, I’m not going into all those texts and uh you will get bored in the history of the whole uh system… That you can read afterwards or you can ask questions. But there was one Tantra, *Mālinīvijayottara-tantra*, which is uh one of the most basic scriptures of the whole system. And Abhinavagupta, the greatest philosopher and mystic of this tradition in the 10th century, he took this *Mālinīvijayottara-tantra* as the basis for his great work *Tantrāloka*, *The Light on the Tantras*. And there he developed this whole… In the Tantra, there are only three verses describing these three *upāyas*. And Abhinavagupta has written 12 volumes uh and expanded it in all its details. 

Not only that. In the *Mālinīvijayottara-tantra*, it starts from *āṇavopāya*, then *śāktopāya*, and then *śāmbhava*. And Abhinavagupta, **he turns the whole thing upside down, and he starts from the top!** And this just shows that the whole approach of the system is: You don’t have to start from the very lowest uh level. You can, if you’re fortunate and if you’re qualified, *can start from the highest*. You don’t have to go step-by-step. 

And he has added a fourth *upāya* which is **anupāya**: **no way**. *Nothing to do, nowhere to go.* **You’re already in that. You are already in that reality.** So you only have to **recognize it**. And that’s why the whole philosophy is called the **philosophy of recognition**. It’s not a philosophy of “knowing” something which is not yourself, which is outside, which is uh objective. It is all a question of **recognition of the self, recognition of one’s divine being**.

###  Apheda: Embracing Non-Difference

So we will have… I mean, in the second part of the introduction, I will give more uh about the content and the program which will follow from tomorrow. But I think as a little background, you have at least some ideas of what is the specific contribution of this spiritual and philosophical tradition which is not in opposition to any… They have been in a very deep dialogue with the Buddhist philosophers. That Mathieu is also time quoted by Abhinavagupta. So there was a a lot of interaction with other systems, but they have retained their own identity while being in dialogue with all the other systems. 

And this is something which we need today also because there is so much of a tendency to, “This is *my* system, this is *my*…” This whole uh fundamentalism or separation. **The whole… If you summarize the whole philosophy, it is called apheda: non-difference.** **Don’t make these splits. Don’t separate yourself from the other, from nature, from uh the whole cosmos.** It is **apheda** we have to reach that level of **non-difference, non-differentiation, non-separation**. 

And **that is the real aim**, which is not just for your individual *mukti*, but it is for the whole world. So if more people practice and experience this **non-difference, non-separation**, then we would have a much more peaceful and harmonious world. 

The *pañca śloka*, and then the… The vector… Vector… Vector… Vector… 
*Namaḥ Śivāya. Namaḥ Śivāya.* Prakāśa… Prakāśa… Now… Now… Yes, means… Yes, please. That’s a… Only the first, only the first, only the first is visible now.
