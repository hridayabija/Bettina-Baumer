Good morning. Please open page 39 in your booklet, but we are going to start with the recitation of the first—not the first—Verses 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the *Saṃbandhasaṅgāha* of *Anantaśakti*, which is not with you. What is with you, uh, the verses we are going to discuss and to study are the verses. So, those of us who know at 12 o’clock you will also [have] the *Saṃbandha* recitation. But, uh, before we start with those verses, just a minute. 

Before we start with our text of today, uh, there are a few announcements. One is that since Sūrya—we are today worshiping Sūrya—uh, Sūrya has become very kind, and if it is not raining in the afternoon, we could have a long walk together, which, uh, will give me—and you also—the chance to talk to each other individually, because, uh, I also have this wish and some of you have also expressed it. And while walking, it’s always nice to talk. So, if the weather does not change, we will organize that and then we’ll announce what time we start and where we go, et cetera. And if we do a long walk, then the, uh, 5 o’clock meditation we will do outside, either walking in silence or finding [a] place to sit. But of course to sit you need some cushion or something to carry. That we will adapt to the situation. Otherwise, we can also just have the same time to walk in silence. This [is] another way of meditation. Then, um, yeah the group discussion and the 5 o'clock meditation will be outside. 

Okay. And then the evening after dinner or before the night meditation, Mike is going to play his singing bowls, and then from there we go into the night meditation.

Then, uh, it always happens, you know, in the course... Sorry, uh, talking... Some mistakes happen, so I have to rectify a few things which I, uh... Can you give me that, uh, outline of *Saṃbandhasaṅgāha*? But which I did not make clear yesterday, or it was incomplete?

Then, I just mentioned about the *yoginīs*, because it was all about the *yoginīs* who reveal this *Vātula*-*nātha*-*sūtra* to *Vātula*-*nātha*. But then I mentioned the *yoginīs* who were in the lineage. And, uh, I was not very precise, because this I have to complement in the same tradition, the *krama* tradition, which we have... *Nityānanda-nātha* yesterday. There were others mentioned by *Abhinavagupta* and his commentator *Jayaratha*, that there were in the lineage of *krama*, *Śivānanda-nātha*, also called *Jñānānanda*-*nātha*, who transmitted his teaching to three *yoginīs*: *Keyūravatī*, *Madanikā*, and *Kalyāṇikā*. And they jointly—I said they initiated women there—initiated very important *gurus* also. They initiated *Govindarāja*, *Amṛtānanda*, and *Eraka*. And the last was the author of the *Krama*-*sūtra*. So, this is a, uh, correction... Which they don't have many names of *yoginīs*. Certainly this that has to be rectified.

And then I also, uh, maybe I made a mistake when saying, uh, about *unmīlana* and *nimīlana* *samādhi*. Uh, of course, *unmīlana* *samādhi* is with open eyes, and *nimīlana* *samādhi* is with closed eyes. So, that is quite clear.

And then also maybe I did not make it sufficiently clear that I find a text like *Vātula*-*nātha*-*sūtra* and commentary an ideal connection of that common ground with the Buddhist *tantra* and the *yoginī-tantras* in Buddhism. And, uh, so I did not want to make any difference there. This is precisely on that ground where, uh, both *śūnyatā* and *madhyā* are experienced that we are very much, uh, in that same spiritual, uh, spiritual tradition. And, uh... Uh, so I... That is very clear that every tradition, every, uh, *saṃpradāya* or religion develops one aspect to the utmost. And what [is it that] Buddhism [develops]? Of course, *śūnyatā*. And Śaivism, *pūrṇatā*. So, these are the historical developments which arise out of those experiences which we are studying and trying to practice here.

Now, we are in the middle of two processes: One is finding our way through the texts, which is not always easy, and the other is the spiritual process, which... Now [on] the third [or] fourth day... So, something has happened. They are moving in a certain direction. And, uh, again it is our task to bring these two processes together: What we learn from the texts and then what we experience in meditation. So, this is a transition phase, and they are again in the middle of our *samādhi*, in the middle where there’s a building-up phase, and then there is a phase of, uh, integration, and then there’s a phase—some, hopefully, of some kind of fulfillment. 

Now we come to our text of today. As I told you in the beginning, the text I have chosen for the theme of *madhyā* are very different in style, in content, and, uh, they’re not in any historical development. But you will see at the end that they are all leading to the same point from their particular, uh, method and expression. So, we had one *tantra*, that is *Vijñāna*-*bhairava*, then we had these *sūtras*—it, uh, it’s a little bit marginal even to *trika* and *spanda* *vijñāna*. They... Because they transcend all these, uh, concepts and rules, and, uh, they are extremely, uh, moving in that space of freedom. And today we have a hymn, *stotra*, which is again to integrate all these different, uh, spiritual and religious, uh, traditions. 

It is actually a hymn to Sūrya, to the Sun god. But it is very much integrated into Kashmir Śaivism. And I, I got attracted to it when it was recited at the *yajña* of *Swāmījī*, with a lot of intensity. And it’s not an easy text. It’s highly poetic, but this Kashmiri practice... They recited it with so much intensity. And then I got—at that time, when I just listened, I just understood a few words. And then I got more and more into this, uh, the text and its meaning and its commentary, and then I translated it, et cetera. 

And here the importance for the Kashmir Śaiva traditions, that *Kṣemarāja*, the disciple of *Abhinavagupta* in the 11th century, he wrote a beautiful commentary. And he placed... That is, in the whole hymn, it’s only Sūrya who is praised, but he has identified Sūrya with Śiva. And not in any simple kind of identification, but he calls the Sun *cit-bhānu* or *cit-arka*, the Son of Consciousness. Sūrya is a symbol of consciousness, of ultimate consciousness. 

And then he, he has a, a two-level [system] of interpretation. At the—the Sun, external Sun—he interprets it at the level of, uh, the cosmic level, and then the Sun of Consciousness at the esoteric level. Uh, esoteric, I translate *rahasya-artha*. So, he gives this... Almost these two levels, which the hymn itself suggests, because it goes beyond a description or praise of the Sun. It, it goes very deep into all the implications of, uh, the Sun of Consciousness, and, uh, then the inner Sun, the internal Sun. 

So, here it is not only the word *madhyā* which engages us, but related words like *antara*—in between... I told you that *madhyā* basically means "the center in between."—"between" and, uh, *sandhyā*, because Sūrya, of course, it’s all connected with the cosmic times. And one of the important, uh, ways of celebrating the Sun, since of course in *Saṃhitā*, are the three *sandhyās*, the three junctures of the sunrise, at the zenith, and the sunset. Which is a universal practice of any religious tradition, but specifically related to Sūrya. 

So, we have... Sorry. On, in your booklet, you have, uh, the *ślokas* which we are going to study. So, for those... For those who are fond of Sanskrit poetry, the meter is *mandākrāntā*. *Mandākrāntā* means "the slow moving." It is kind of, you know, imitating the movement of the Sun, the *mandākrāntā*—*tatatā tatatā*, uh. You, you can listen when, when we recite it. 

So far, uh, [the] first five we have already recited, and now we come to the meaning. So that the macrocosmic [and] microcosmic relations are, of course, very prominent in that hymn. And the, the microcosmic are actually *yoga*. They are related to *yoga*. And this is something very interesting, which I only discovered when I was translating the text: That *suṣumnā*—if you look in a dictionary—it does not only mean the central channel in the yogic body, it means also the principal ray of the Sun. So, it is very interesting, you know, that the light character and power and the light—the energy which is in the microcosmic yogic body and the ray of the Sun—is the same word: *suṣumnā*. 

So, you have the translated [text]...

> Make the pure white image of the Supreme Āditya—

Now, here the Āditya is written with, um...

> —who has entered in between the upper and lower worlds—

When he calls it *parama*-*āditya*, he means a mystical Sun. It is not the physical Sun, it’s not Sūrya. But identical, of course. It’s, uh, it... The, the physical Sun is, uh, uh, [a] symbol of that Sun of Consciousness.

> —be propitious unto us.

> That Sun who dwells between all beings—

Already important: *bhuvana* and *sarva-bhūtāntar-sthita*—"who dwells within all beings". 

> —having entered all the manifold veins, is verily the *pramāṇādi* which is attained by the *yogins* who are engaged in absorbing the inhalation and exhalation between the two.

You will see that on any occasion and every kind of text this *prāṇa* *apāna* is always there, and the "in between". And here it is a praise, a prayer to Sūrya, to *parama*-*āditya*, and...

> Who dwells between all beings...

So, it’s not only the external Sun, but the inner Sun dwells within all beings. And the *yogin*, *yogis*, they activate that. They are conscious of that inner Sun. And as the Sun has manifold rays, so in the yogic body you have so many channels, *nāḍīs*. And so this is the macrocosmic correspondence to the rays of the Sun: *Nānā-nāḍī-praśavakaghana*—

> —Having entered all the manifold veins—

And then—

> —which is attained—

No. 

> —It is attained—*prāṇāpāna*-*kramasane rathai*—by the *yogins* who are engaged in absorbing inhalation and exhalation—is attained that *brahmāṇḍi*.

Now, *brahmāṇḍi* and *suṣumnā* is the same, and *madhyā-nāḍi*. *Brahma* means always the, the sacred and the pervasive or pervasive, uh, reality. So, here you have already an identification of the divine Sun—of the physical Sun—with the inner, inner Sun, which is attained. It’s, it is present in every body, of course, but only the *yogis* have the capacity to enter in between *prāṇa* and *apāna* and to attain that *brahmāṇḍi*, that central, uh, channel which is, uh, the same as the principal ray of the Sun.

Now, I am always tempted to quote the commentary by *Kṣemarāja*, but, uh, I have translated it only partially. And then I have to say that there is a beautiful Hindi translation by *Swāmi Lakṣmaṇ Jū*. But, uh, for lack of time, uh, I will only quote some, some phrases which are very helpful for our understanding.

Now, *Swāmījī* has given here a wonderful, uh, also some notes to his Hindi translation:

> *Pramāṇādi* or *cit-devatā me koi bheda nahī hai*. *Brahmāṇḍi kā anubhava hone par hi samasta bhuvano kā jñāna hotā hai*.

Just listen to this.

> *Is kāraṇa se sabhī bhuvana bhī brahmāṇḍi ke hi antargat kahe ja sakte hai*.

So, this is a tremendous... Of course, from his experience and his knowledge of the tradition, that attaining that *brahmāṇḍi*, who is the *cit-devatā*, the, the, the consciousness, the divine consciousness... There’s no difference between the two. And experiencing the *brahmāṇḍi*, one has experience of the cosmos. So, this, uh... It is not when we say, "Well, microcosm, macrocosm..." But it has a tremendous experiential aspect, you know. Unless you enter into that *madhyā*, between *prāṇa* *apāna*, and you experience the *brahmāṇḍi*, you cannot understand what is meant here. It’s entering in that which is the center of consciousness, *cit-devatā*, and which gives you access to a knowledge of the universe. It’s a tremendous statement, which is very much in tune, of course, with *Kṣemarāja*’s interpretation. 

So, this, uh... Mostly I have been teaching this text with people who know Sanskrit, because there’s a lot of, uh, in the commentary which, uh, it cannot... Uh, only partially I have translated that.

So, this is verse five. Then, the next one is 18. Can we recite it from the original? Yeah, that one. 

> We can have it.

Okay. Okay.

> *Agniśomāvakilajagat-kāraṇam tau mayukai sarvādānīśicasi bhagavan prāsa-vṛtti-krameṇa tāvibhāntar viśuvati samau cūpodāmādbhavanau dvāg-vyastaṃ nayasi yukāpaṃ muktaye bhakti-pājam*

> Śiva?

Okay. 

> *Agniśomāvakilajagat-kāraṇam tau mayukai sarvādānīśicasi bhagavan prāsa-vṛtti-krameṇa tāvibhāntar viśuvati samau cūpodāmādbhavanau dvāg-vyastaṃ nayasi yukāpaṃ muktaye bhakti-pājam*

> We can have it.

Okay. Okay. 

> *Agniśomāvakilajagat-kāraṇam tau mayukai sarvādānīśicasi bhagavan prāsa-vṛtti-krameṇa tāvibhāntar viśuvati samau cūpodāmādbhavanau dvāg-vyastaṃ nayasi yukāpaṃ muktaye bhakti-pājam*

> *Agniśomāvakilajagat-kāraṇam tau mayukai sarvādānīśicasi bhagavan prāsa-vṛtti-krameṇa tāvibhāntar viśuvati samau cūpodāmādbhavanau dvāg-vyastaṃ nayasi yukāpaṃ muktaye bhakti-pājam*

> *Svadāt-hastāṃ yatanu-kuvanā-nyantarā sanni-viṣṭā nānā-nāḍi-prasavagahanā sarvabhūtāntar-sthā prāṇāpāna-prasana-nirathai prāpyate paṃ-bhavāṇī sānā śvetā bhavatu para-mādityamūrti-prasannā*

This hymn is, uh, highly poetic, and, uh, there is some sequence, but one can also take the verses individually. They have a, uh, completeness in [and] of themselves. But a little connection one has to establish here. Because the previous verse is about *bhakti*. It [will] just give you this connection with *bhakti* in the previous verse.

> O Sūrya, when you first arise, you drive away the darkness from the hearts of the devotees. Then, you remove *rajas* (passion), due to predominance of *sattva* (purity). Finally, you increase *sattva* by progressive *karma-yoga*, which has been properly practiced. Devotion to you, like the three *vedas*, leads those peaceful ones to liberation.

So, what is placed here is actually *bhakti*, the devotion to Sūrya. And in verse 18... Having attained that, that *bhakti*, because it’s feminine down... Now, this is a very beautiful, uh, very beautiful [set of] examples [of] how this *bhakti* can protect [you], can be with you in all kinds of situations. It’s very beautiful, very touching. 

> She is like the Goddess Śrī in the house, like *kāmadhenu* in a foreign place—

I will explain.

> —like a torch in darkness, like fearlessness in a forest, like the central vein (*brahmāṇḍi*) in *yoga*. And in the ocean of *saṃsāra*, full of the crocodiles of the various sense objects, she is like a saving boat. May I reach your Supreme Immortality, which is neither cold nor hot. 

Now, it’s very beautiful what this *bhakti* can do in all kinds of situations. She’s like Śrī in the house. Śrī means prosperity, happiness, beauty, everything that is, uh, in, in the house. Then, *kāmadhenu* in a foreign place. And here, *Kṣemarāja* has a nice, uh, interpretation: What is that foreign place? 

Foreign place is where your relatives and friends are absent. And there you need, you need some help. So, *kāmadhenu*, that wish-fulfilling cow, she can supply everything what you need if you are in a foreign place. And, and, and she is... She gives you courage when you’re in a forest; you’re full of wild animals and, uh... Uh, so, she gives you courage. And in attaining *yojanai*, in *yoga*, she is the *brahmāṇḍi*.  So, *bhakti* herself—*bhakti*—you need *bhakti* also for *yoga*. And this is something which is sometimes forgotten. Without *bhakti* there’s no *yoga*. And, uh, so, *yojanai brahmāṇḍi*. And here, *Kṣemarāja* says, "*Yojanai* means *parasivātmaikya-āveśī brahmāṇḍi suṣumnā*." So, he identifies her with *suṣumnā*, which is that *brahmāṇḍi*. It makes you enter or penetrate in the oneness with the Supreme Śiva, *Parasivāikya-āveśa*. It makes you absorbed in the oneness with Supreme Śiva. And because, uh, here *yojanā* is the reference to the traditional definition of *yoga*... Now, we have this in the *Netra*-*tantra*: *Yoga* is defined as uniting one with the other. And here, uniting the devotee with the Supreme Śiva. *Yojanai brahmāṇḍi*. And this *brahmāṇḍi* is, of course, *suṣumnā*. And she is also like a boat which helps you to cross over the terrible ocean of *saṃsāra*, full of the crocodiles of the senses, which are distracting and disturbing. It’s such a beautiful... This [is] very highly poetical, and very, uh, touching: How this *bhakti* can be with you in all kinds of situations. And here, among the normal situations is *yoga*: *yojanai brahmāṇḍi*. So, in *yoga*, this *bhakti* becomes the—or *is* the—central channel. 

*Kṣemarāja* says about *agni* *soma* that they cause, uh...

> Can we relate *prāṇa* and *apāna* to both *agni* and *soma*? Which is more *agni*, which is more *soma*? *Prāṇa* is... 

Yes.

> Is it more *agni* or more *soma*? Uh, *agni*?

*Agni*. And... Sorry, not *agni*. Sūrya. 

> Yeah. Sūrya, *soma*, and *agni*. *Sūrya soma agni*.

Yes. Now we come to a very crucial verse, 20. This verse... This verse gives us the key to not only [understanding] the *Saṃbandhasaṅgāha*, but for the whole theme of *madhyā*. Because in one verse, it, uh, enumerates all kinds of pairs of opposites, and the *yogin* who has to enter in between—in the middle—between them. So then we can... And this I would, uh, also suggest, um, one can take any one of these aspects and meditate on it. It’s how you can enter in the middle, between any one of these pairs of complementarities or opposites, whatever you call it. So, [here is the] translation, and then [the] commentary. 

> The *yogin* who enters within the pairs of opposites, such as *agni* and *soma*, *prakrti* and *puruṣa*, *bindu* and *nāda*, *prāṇa* and *apāna*, day and night, truth and falsehood, *dharma* and *adharma*, reality and unreality, which are ever-present, being free from them in his mind, remains within himself. He enters in you who are free from qualities. 

So, so here in the text itself, it’s the *yogin* who is [the] important [figure]. The *yogin*, who can only have access to that highest level of *nirguṇa*, of the divine. And he can have it by entering in the middle of all these pairs. Now, let us see the commentary, and then we can give our, uh, uh, [attempt to] try to understand...

> *Kṣemarāja* says about *agni* *soma* that they cause the appearance and the stability of everything in the world, in this cosmos—*Viśvātmaka vibhāva*—and the... There’s a very long commentary, but, uh...

Yeah.

> —Offering them in the fire of the self—

And this is, uh, very important, uh, *cūpodāmātmana nau*. Still I fill them with the... Read the Hindi, uh, translation. 

> The offering them in the fire of the self...

Now you know that in between *prāṇa* and *apāna* is *udāna*, and *udāna* [is] the rising breath, which is fire. It is, it is fire, uh, identified with fire. And this *soma* equally... You lead them equally. And that equality, which is like the equinox in the whole year... So, as you said, not contrary, but complementarities. And that center, which is either *sandhyā* in the course of the day, or, uh, *viṣuvat* in the equinox in the year. So, because it’s a hymn to Sūrya, so all these cosmic, uh, elements come into, uh, play. See that the time, uh, cosmic time, and then the cosmic time, which is [in] inner time... Internalized. So, internalize that equality between the equinox... The equality is again to be realized internally in that *samatā*, that balance, that harmony, that equality. So, just one phrase under this from *Swāmījī*'s, uh, translation: 

> *Ātmā agni me sāmya bhāva se samarpit karte hai*.

Yeah, this is the *prāṇāpāna*. 

> *Ātmā agni me sāmya bhāva se samarpit karte hai ya*. This is the... *Phirun un bhaktõ ko mukti dilāne ke liye āp in dono arthāt prāṇa aur apāna ko ek hi samay me lay karte hai*.

So, this is important. See [how] we deal with this *prāṇa* and *apāna*. It is either [that] you, you enter in between and then the fire of *udāna* rises, or you bring them to a state of equality, which is like the equinox in the whole year. So, this micro [and] macrocosmic, it plays all the time in, in this whole hymn.

*Kṣemarāja* says about *agni* *soma* that they cause the appearance and the stability of everything in the world, in this cosmos—*Viśvātmaka vibhāva*—and the... There’s a very long commentary, but... Yeah.

> Offering them in the fire of the self. 

And this is, uh, very important, uh, *cūpodāmātmana nau*. 

Still I fill them with the... Read the Hindi, uh, translation: 

> Offering them in the fire of the self. 

And this is a very important, uh, *cūpodāmātmana nau*. So, in the whole, uh, symbolism of, uh, *prāṇa* *apāna* *udāna*, it is, uh, Sun, Moon, and fire. So, that’s where the center is, uh, the fire, *cit*. And now...

> Can we relate *prāṇa* and *apāna* to both *agni* and *soma*? Which is more *agni*, which is more *soma*? 

*Prāṇa* is... Yes. 

> Is it more *agni* or more *soma*? Uh, *agni*? 

And... Sorry, not *agni*. Sūrya.

> Yeah. Sūrya, *soma*, and *agni*. *Sūrya soma agni*. 

Yes. Now we come to a very crucial verse: 20. This verse, this verse gives us the key to—not only [understanding] the *Saṃbandhasaṅgāha*—but for the whole theme of *madhyā*. Because in one verse, it, uh, enumerates all kinds of pairs of opposites, and the *yogin* who has to enter in between—in the middle—between them. So then we can... And this I would, uh, also suggest—um—one can take any one of these aspects and meditate on it. It’s how you can enter in the middle between any one of these pairs of complementarities or opposites, whatever you call it. So, [here is the] translation, and then commentary.

> The yogi who enters within the pairs of opposite such as *agni* and *soma*, *prakrti* and *puruṣa*, *bindu* and *nāda*, *prāṇa* and *apāna*, day and night, truth and falsehood, *dharma* and *adharma*, reality and unreality, which are ever present, being free from them in his mind, remains within himself. He enters in you who are free from qualities. 

So, the... So, here, it... In the text itself, it’s the *yogin* who is the important [figure]. The *yogin*, who can only have access to that highest level of *nirguṇa*, of the divine. And he can have it by entering in the middle of all these pairs. Now, let us see the commentary, and then we can give our... [Attempt to] try to understand... 

> You means the Lord, Bhagavān. So, this pair cosmically is *agni* and *soma*, which are the cause of the whole world. And the, in the yogic, uh, experience, they are again *prāṇa* and *apāna*. Here, *Swāmījī* has...

Still, I fill them with the... Read the Hindi, uh, translation: 

> Offering them in the fire of the self...

Now, you know that in between *prāṇa* and *apāna* is *udāna*, and *udāna*, the rising breath, which is fire. It is, it is fire identified with fire. 

> And this *soma* equally... You lead them equally. And that equality which is like the equinox in the whole year... So, as you said, not contrary, but complementarities. And that center which is either *sandhyā* in the course of the day or, uh, *viṣuvat* in the equinox in the year. So, because it’s a hymn to Sūrya, so all these cosmic, uh, elements come into, uh, play. See that the time, uh, cosmic time, and then the cosmic time which is in inner time... Internalized. So, internalize that equality between the equinox... The equality is again to be realized internally in that *samatā*, that balance, that harmony, that equality. So, just one phrase under this from *Swāmījī*'s, uh, translation: 

> *Ātmā agni me sāmya bhāva se samarpit karte hai*. 

Yeah, this is the *prāṇāpāna*.

> *Ātmā agni me sāmya bhāva se samarpit karte hai ya*... This is the... *Phirun un bhaktõ ko mukti dilāne ke liye āp in dono arthāt prāṇa aur apāna ko ek hi samay me lay karte hai*. 

So, this is important. See the [how we] deal with this *prāṇa* and *apāna*. It is either you, you enter in between and then the fire of *udāna* rises, or you bring them to a state of equality, which is like the equinox in the whole year. So, this micro [and] macrocosmic, it plays all the time in, in this whole hymn.

And the basic duality is always *prāṇa* *apāna*. Then the next is, uh, *bindu* and *nāda*. And *bindu* and *nāda*, he explains as *vedanānubhavaḥ*... *bindu* as pure perception, and *nāda* as reflection... *vedanānubhavaḥ*. 

And day and night is also very beautiful. Of course, day and night is easy to, uh, understand; it [relates to] *sandhyā*, the "in between." But, uh, he makes it more, uh, explicit: *prasavaviśrānti bhavat svābhāvikī*. Because the day has the nature of activity, flowing out, and the night has the nature of rest. The night you rest, and the day you are active. So, finding the middle between—and this is something you can apply psychologically, you know—finding the in between [of] activity and rest. *prasavaviśrānti*. See, there are people who are either given too much to activity, or too much to laziness. So, to find that balance, uh, between *prasava* and *viśrānti*, that is the middle between day and night. 

*Prāṇa* and *apāna* there—of course, whenever such, uh, this whole topic comes up, *prāṇa* and *apāna* are always the key. So, because we always come back [to] you, to your yogic body, and to the *prāṇas*. This is the basis, and this is the, the crux of the whole practice. You can apply it here and there to cosmic and, uh, other, uh, psychological affairs. But *prāṇa* and *apāna* are the central, central practice and central experience. So, you cannot go from here if you have not tried to find the middle between *prāṇa* and *apāna*. And that is *udāna*. That is the rising breath, and the rising breath which gives access to *kuṇḍalinī*, of course. So, *suṣumnā*... *prāṇa* *apāna*. 

Then... And this is again very interesting and [relates to] this whole tantric spirituality: That you don’t choose. You don’t say, "No, no, I only want truth, I don’t want falsehood." You find the middle between the two. And this is, uh... This is why the task is much more difficult. It’s easier to give up something, to say, "No, I don’t want this." But to find the center between truth and falsehood, between being and non-being... It’s a much more subtle, uh, process.

So, you have, uh, *satyānṛta*—truth and falsehood. *dharma adharma*—righteousness and unrighteousness, again. Normally, you know, you should give up *adharma* and stick to *dharma*. So, it’s much more subtle to find the center between the two. So that is a very subtle process of understanding reality—not in terms of either/or, but in terms of *madhyā*. This is the whole thing, the teaching which we should learn here: Not either/or. 

And we live so much in this either/or, whether in morality, or in social, uh, action, in, uh... Politically, anyhow, we don’t talk about that at all. But, uh, this either/or... And where people who are good people, you know, but they think, "No, I have to give up all this." But they don’t try to find the center. And finding the center is precisely the... This is the healing power in our whole world. It’s finding the center, and not rejecting something. Because even rejecting has—of course, psychologists can tell us—that any suppression, any rejection... It has its after-effects. At some point, it will come up. See how much you try to be very truthful, to be very good, to be very, uh, *dharmika*, to be... But there’s always some element of the opposite also. So, if you don’t recognize that, and if you don’t deal with it, then, it remains a one-sided, uh, affair in, in [your] whole life. So between *dharma* and *adharma*, between *satya* and *anṛta*, finding the center... I leave it to you in your meditation and your understanding, uh, how you apply it. But the general principle is precisely this: Not to reject something, but to find the middle. 

So, I [will] just finish with this, and then we have... *sat asat*. *sat asat*—existence and non-existence. And then, the important [part]—the whole practice for the *yogin*—is said in one word: *yo'ntarāveśa-yogi*—the *yogin* who enters in the middle of this pair. And he only attains—you means that divine Sun—

> —who are free from qualities, *nirguṇa*.

Who are free from... Because any *guṇa* will have its opposite. Like, uh, *tamas*, and *rajas*, and all that. So, it’s not a question of choosing one of the opposites, but of *antarāveśa*—entering in between—and there finding that *nirguṇa*... What we had yesterday, *śūnya*. It is *nirguṇa* also... *śūnyatā*. That, uh... Free from any particular qualities or qualifications. 

So, even if you don’t understand any particular pair of opposites, but the general, uh, idea, I think, is very clear, and we have to take... We can take out of these examples one, you know. *prāṇa apāna* is always with us. And, um,  *puruṣa prakrti*. And if you are very deeply in meditation, certainly some, something may happen: The between being and non-being. Between *bindu* and *nāda*...

> Would we...

Yes. A, one note by *Swāmījī*... *madhyā*, this [is] always very helpful:

> *Āvive prāye he kisabhī saṃsārik dvandvon ke madhya me daharā huā īśvar sāre saṃsāra kā ādhār banā huā hai*. 

See, all these *dvandvas*, and to be in the center, which is the divine, which is *nirguṇa*—without qualities. So, I think this verse, uh, shall be with us—at least the overall meaning—and then you can take, uh, any example of any pair of opposites or pair of complementarities and then try to enter, enter into the center. Let us have it. Take... That is, conclude with 35? 35, yeah. 

> We recite it together:

> *Agniśomāvakilajagat-kāraṇam tau mayukai sarvādānīśicasi bhagavan prāsa-vṛtti-krameṇa tāvibhāntar viśuvati samau cūpodāmādbhavanau dvāg-vyastaṃ nayasi yukāpaṃ muktaye bhakti-pājam*

This verse... This verse gives us the key to—not only [understanding] the *Saṃbandhasaṅgāha*—but for the whole theme of *madhyā*. Because in one verse, it, uh, enumerates all kinds of pairs of opposites, and the yogi who has to enter in between, in the middle, between them. So, then we can... And this I would, uh, also suggest—um—one can take any one of these aspects and meditate on it. It’s how you can enter in the middle between any one of these pairs of complementarities or opposites, whatever you call it. So, [here is the] translation, and then [the] commentary:

> The yogi who enters within the pairs of opposite such as *agni* and *soma*, *prakrti* and *puruṣa*, *bindu* and *nāda*, *prāṇa* and *apāna*, day and night, truth and falsehood, *dharma* and *adharma*, reality and unreality, which are ever present, being free from them in his mind, remains within himself. He enters in you who are free from qualities. 

So that... So, here, it... In the text itself, it’s the yogi who is the important [figure]. The yogi who can only have access to that highest level of *nirguṇa*, of the divine. And he can have it by entering in the middle of all these pairs. Now, let us see the commentary, and then we can give our, uh, uh, [attempt to] try to understand... We have repeatedly said that *madhyā*—finding *madhyā*—is overcoming of dualities. Now, one fundamental cosmic duality is for—that comes from the Vedic, uh, context—*agni* and *soma*. So, these are the cosmic forces which are fiery and watery. Soma is, of course, the Moon, but *soma* is also *amṛta*. It is also liquid. It is water. And the fiery and the watery, which are also the, the male and the female... And all these pairs of, uh, opposites, which are cosmically expressed as *agni* and *soma*. And, uh... So, it’s always a question of finding the center between this, uh... The word "opposite" is not very correct—[they are] complementarities—because the universe would not exist without the two. If there was only the power of fire, [or] if it was only the power of water... It exists only because of the interaction of these two, uh, factors.

> O Lord, *agni* and *soma* are the causes of the whole world. By your rays you create their emission and withdrawal in the order of decrease and increase. You lead the two equally in the inner juncture, *viṣuvat*, offering them in the fire of the self. And you dissolve them in an instant to give liberation to your devotees. 

Now, this is a very, uh, again... The cosmic and the, the microcosm, the yogic, are very much intertwined here. When he says—

> —You lead the two as *agni* and *soma* equally in this inner juncture—

Now, *viṣuvat* and *abhiciṭ*, they are... They mean "equinox" cosmically... Cosmically, they are the equinoxes. But in this system, they are mystical terms. They are precisely designating that central... And equinox is the equilibrium of, uh, the time, and, uh, in the center. So, *viṣuvat* and *abhiciṭ*, uh, are... And macrocosmically—or yogically—they are related to *prāṇa* and *apāna*; [they] mean, uh, the juncture in between. Now, "juncture," we will come to another verse, um, which is, of course, very much in practice [in] religious practices: *sandhyā*. *Sandhyā* means the juncture—again, temporal juncture—between morning and, uh, night and morning, and all the three *sandhyās*. And it has, again, in this tradition, a very mystical implication. *Sandhyā* is that, uh, meeting point, and the transition... Point of transition, which is both very sacred and also vulnerable. So, why [does] one perform[] ritual at the *sandhyā*? Because it’s a very vulnerable time when the night passes into the day, or the day into [the] night. And so *sandhyā* is another word for *madhyā*—cosmically—or from the course of the Sun, uh, in the day. So...

> You means the Lord, Bhagavān. So, this pair cosmically is *agni* and *soma*, which are the cause of the whole world. And the, in the yogic, uh, experience, they are again *prāṇa* and *apāna*. Here, *Swāmījī* has... 

Still I fill them with the... Read the Hindi, uh, translation: 

> Offering them in the fire of the self... 

*Kṣemarāja* says about *agni* *soma* that they cause the appearance and the stability of everything in the world, in this cosmos—*Viśvātmaka vibhāva*—and *viśuvātmaka*. Yeah. 

> Offering them in the fire of the self. 

And this is a very important *cūpodāmātmana nau*. So, in the whole, uh, symbolism of, uh, *prāṇa* *apāna* *udāna*, it is, uh, Sun, Moon, and fire. So that’s where the center is, uh, the fire, *cit*. And now, uh... One note by *Swāmījī*, *madhyā*—this [is] always very helpful—

> *Āvive prāye he kisabhī saṃsārik dvandvon ke madhya me daharā huā īśvar sāre saṃsāra kā ādhār banā huā hai*.

See all these *dvandvas*, and to be in the center, which is the divine, which is *nirguṇa*—without qualities. 

So, I think this verse, uh, shall be with us—at least the overall meaning—and then you can take, uh, any example of any pair of opposites or pair of complementarities, and then try to, enter, enter into the center. So, I think this verse, uh, shall be with us—at least the overall meaning—and then you can take a any example of any pair of opposites or pair of complementarities, and then try to enter into the center.
