First, we have the good news that today is equinox. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow is equinox. So, we are at a very auspicious time. And we have some of your family here today from the Jewish tradition. So, I am sure you can tell much more than what I can say. And in Kashmir, Jewish is very important. I have always met those Pandit who came to Kashmir, and we see and gave them (Did they involved in all that?) Now, we come back for a moment to twenty-five because I have actually translated the commentary. And those of you who want to have a copy, I have it in printed for you. So, just look at the text, and this is the commentary by Kṣemarāja.

> The yogin who enters or merges in the central inner rising *prāṇa* in between the eternal and the temporary — It's one pair I have left out in my explanation — in between the eternal and the temporary. So it's neither only temporal nor only eternal but in between. In between the eternal and the temporary, which is ever flowing in the form of exhalation and inhalation. In between Agni and Soma, in the form of swallowing or consuming and nourishing. That is the two qualities of Agni and Soma. 

*Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*, in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*, predominantly the energies of activity and knowledge; in between *Bindu* and *Nada*, because of their form of perception or experience and reflection; in between day and night, due to their states of spreading out and repose; in between truth and falsehood, due to their being caused by expansion and contraction of consciousness. Now, this is very important. I didn't explain it before. Truth and falsehood are aspects of expansion of consciousness and contraction of consciousness. So, that makes us also, you know, we are often so intolerant people who are false or who are not truthful, etc. But to look at these two as Saṁkucita-Vikāsa, we know this is a very important pair. *Vikāsa* means expansion of consciousness, and *Saṁkucita* is a limitation or restriction; contraction of consciousness. So, if you look at all the negative things as aspects of contraction of consciousness, *Saṁkucita*. And that our aim, and the aim of the yogin, the aim of the spiritual practitioner is to expand consciousness.

So, this is that certain with that truth and falsehood, due to their being caused by expansion and contraction of consciousness. In between righteousness and unrighteousness, being caused by ascending and descending movements. It's also interesting. See, righteousness Dharma is a movement of ascent to the divinity or to that light, or whatever. *Dharma* is ascent, and *adharma* is descent. So, that in between ascent and descent. In between being and non-being, manifesting or making known the existence or non-existence of external reality. And this is now we have it from the *Ṛgveda* to all the Buddhist analysis of reality. And the *Ṛgveda*, this one hymn, you know, (Where is it — be or non-be, etc.) in between both.

The yogin who enters the central abode of the inner rising breath, thus merging in the abode of consciousness of the Self — moving means being established therein — he enters the Supreme Sun, Sun beyond dualities. In the beyond qualities. Now, etcetera, just so much. He enters the Supreme Sun beyond qualities. They will come.

So, if you are interested, one can make photocopies of commentary because this is really very important verse. And what we have just recited is another clue to the whole practice and experience of *Matṛkā*. And these verses already make clear that the *Saṁbhavapañcāśikā* was not just a hymn to the Sun. It was very much Yogic, very much directed to the experience of the microcosmic Yoga experience.

And here we have that beautiful — again, what is day and what is night spiritually? Day, according to this tradition... or some... Those were fully awakened. Some of them touch. And the day illuminated by the light of reality, or those who have entered the Yogic sleep in the night of the quieting of the mind, *cittopaśama*, having pierced through the light of the Sun at the junctures between day and night, full of Supreme bliss, they attained the Supreme state of Nirvāṇa. This is a tremendous verse. It's not as difficult as the previous ones. And it's very clear.

So, what is day? Day in the true sense is the day of reality. *Sattva*. *Sattva* dina. So, dina. So, the true day is that where the light of reality shines. Not just the external Sun, the light of reality shines. And those who are fully awakened in that day, where the light of reality shines. And those who are asleep, who have entered the Yogic sleep (Here *yoganidrā* is not what you call in *Haṭhayoga*, *yoganidrā*, but it is what state is very different.)

What is night? Night is the time for the quieting of the mind, *cittopaśama*. The quieting of the mind — that is night. And the Supreme night. So, those who enter into that night of the quieting of the mind, there in that state of *yoganidrā*, in the true sense... So, there's no question of both day and night are states of awakening, states of enlightenment, enlightenment, *Sambodhata*. But, one is in the light of consciousness, the other is the quieting of the mind, *cittopaśama*. That is the real night. So, it doesn't matter whether it's day or night, but if you experience that light of reality or that quieting of the mind, this is day, and that is night. And, but that is not all. As I said in the beginning, one important word for *Matṛkā* in the cosmic sense is *Sandhyā*. It's the juncture. Juncture between day and night. So that... And, it is in those junctures, times of juncture, between that day of enlightenment and the night of quieting of the mind — in those junctures, there is the Supreme bliss. It's experienced. *Parama-nandasaṁdhyā*. And again, that is not all. What leads to *Nirvāṇa*, to complete liberation, is piercing through the light, to the physical light. *Bhitvā sauram jyotim*. *Bhitvā*. Only by when you pierce through the physical light, that you attain that Supreme light, which is *Nirvāṇa*, which is liberation.

Now, at the end of the *Iśopaniṣad*, there is the prayer of the dying, and of the dying (or of the relatives of the dying) where the dying has a vision of the Supreme Sun. He has a vision of that that is described as a golden, golden disk, golden disk. And, but before he attains his liberation, he has to pierce through that. And, then only he attain liberation. And I'm sorry I didn't bring the *Iśopaniṣad*, I have it at home that... Yes. So, this is actually the same thing in that Tantric context, that the light of the Sun has... it is a great symbol. It is our cosmic existence depends on it. But, we have to pierce through that to gain liberation. So, what is true day? What is the true night? And, what is the true *Sandhyā*, juncture in between, and then piercing through that to... Yes, but Kṣemarāja says... _Sthūlaṁ jyotis saṁkucitaṁ prakāśaṁ bhitvā..._ He is saying that gross light, that physical light, the cosmic light — piercing through that which is... because anything which is limited, which is still in the cosmic sphere, Saṁkucita prakāśam, it is limited light. So, that divine light or that absolute light is beyond that. So, piercing through that limited light to that absolute light. _Sthūlaṁ jyotis saṁkucitaṁ prakāśaṁ bhitvā niśaṁskāraṁ vilābhya paraṁ devānamārgaṁ yānti satā paraṁ śaktaṁ tamāśritāḥ_. And, those who can, who pierce through that physical limited physical light, they go to the path of *Nirvāṇa*, of liberation. _Satā paraṁ śaktaṁ tamāśritāḥ_. So, that is not only a death, it is already in *jīvanmukti*. And, what is that state of *Nirvāṇa* is *paraṁ śaktam tama*. Now, it is the Supreme light-ful abode of energy, *śaktam tama*. The *tama* is an abode. But, it's a light-filled abode of energy. So, this is the spiritual light, you can say. Crossing over the physical light to the spiritual light, which is the light of Supreme energy, *paraṁ śaktam tama* in Kṣemarāja. 

Now, here again, we have that that great connection between the cosmic, the spiritual, and the the two paths — *pitṛyāṇa* and *devayāna*. And, the equinox. So, we are at the right time to study this text. *Viśuvat* and *Abijit*. So, translation of the paths — there is the northern course associated with the cold season, the way of the gods, *devayāna*, and the southern course of the fathers, *pitṛpakṣa*. The dark one associated with the seasons that start with the rains. Apart from these two, there is another one. The central course. (There's a mistake.) central course of the equinoxes. *Viśuvant* and *abhijit*, devoid of activity. May this state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* be auspicious to me. *Kṛtyasūnya* — again we have that that void in between. So, the equinox, as we said before, is a state of equality of the two halves of the year. And the devotee (or Saṁba, and they say Saṁba) — Saṁba is the son of Kṛṣṇa who is the author of this *Stotra*. He prays, "Let my... let my state or my *Vṛtti* (We had a lot yesterday with the... what we learn about that.) Let my... let my course... Let my course of action. Or, let my being or let my activity be in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*." And here it is clear that, again, like the previous verse, *Prakṛti* stands for *kriyāśakti*, for activity, and *Puruṣa* for *jñānaśakti*, for knowledge. 

So, "Let my state in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*, in between *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, and that equinox." An equinox is *viśuvant*. An *abhijit* is a mystical term in this tradition.

Kṣemarāja, you can interpreted... interprets the cosmic time, consisting of the two halves of the year — the northern and southern (*uttarāyaṇa* and *dakṣiṇāyaṇa*) course in terms of the Yogic breaths. The prayer for attaining a middle state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* is identified with the two breaths, the left and right course. As the two equinoxes (*viśuvant* and *abhijit*) are the cosmic times of the in between, they are given an esoteric meaning. And, this is important. *Viśuvant*, which is the great pervasiveness, conquers, *abhijayati*, due to the pacification or enduring of duality. And, it is such due to its overcoming all. It is *abhijit*. So, that *abhijit* means overcoming. It is void of activity of good or evil nature, because its essence is a resting in its own bliss, *svānanda viśrāṇti sāgaravat*. It's very beautiful. It's again and again, that middle state, whether it's in the cosmic or in the Yogic, and the the the times of the year or of the day, that middle state, that *Sandhyā*, is full of bliss. It's blissful, because it is beyond these dualities. The two courses of the Sun correspond to *prāṇa* and *apāna*. And, what is different of them, the center, *Viśuvant*, *jīvanmukti*. This is all from Kṣemarāja. The state of *unmanā*, the transmental state. Again, also *viśuvant* is... _Prakṛti-Puruṣa ke madhye meṁ ṭhere hue be prāṇa-apāna se mukt unmanā-nāmak hui alaukik madhyama vṛtti hai_. So, that transcendental state, which is in Yoga, *unmanā*, the trans-mental, because *prāṇa-apāna*, this duality is always still with the mind. The mind is there. Only in the center, you transcend the mind, to that state beyond the mind, *unmanā*. And, where he *mukta sadā keliye prāpto*, that is the prayer. And, _tamī astu vṛtti dvayatapaśamanāt yasya_, pacifying the duality. It makes it very pacifying, all these dualities — cosmic, the year, the the the the breaths — it are all connected and corresponding. And, the yogin experiences it always in the *vṛtti*, the *prāṇa*.

So, this contains, of course, a lot... a lot... all understanding of *pitṛyāṇa*, *devayāna*. And, which is very important for the... the... of course, for the rituals for *śrāddha*, *śrāddha*, and connected with death. And, so, here the prayer is to be in that state in the middle, or in the state of harmony, of the equinox. Neither this nor that, but in between.

Now, we come to the last verse of the selection. *Sambhavapañcāśikā* means literally the fifty verses of *Saṁba*. And *Saṁba* is the author, and the son of Kṛṣṇa, who was smitten by the disease of leprosy, and he was instructed by the Ṛṣis that he should worship the Sun in order to be healed. And, this is still alive in Benares. We have a temple under the God to *Sūrya*, where people come for healing from skin diseases. It's very much common, like in Orissa also. And, so, the whole recitation and composition of the hymn, and the end, of course, he is healed. He is completely, not only healed, but also liberated. So, physical healing is only one aspect, but the liberation which is beyond the physical healing. 

So, this is really, "Let me become that bridge — Setubandhasya." And so, the yogin himself becomes that *Matṛkā*. And, if he becomes that Sun of consciousness, that again he can enlighten the whole world, as I have said in the very beginning, that I mean, our Guru has given five ways to get enlightenment, starting from the firefly to the Sun. But, here the aim is very clearly stated, once — he has to become the Sun of consciousness. To *Sūrya*.

For those who are, of course, the beautiful Hindi translation. But, it was a question of time. For those who want, they can have it. I can copy of... get a copy of this translation by Somayaji. 

You have it? Good. You have it? Digital? Oh, very good. So, you can share it. So, please ask Aditya. He's already here, with the the light name. 

So, I think we have reached a very high stage in that poetic expression of the search for that center. And, the center of consciousness, which is the Sun, and the inner Sun, which builts all beings, and with which we can become one in that center. So, we have ended a little earlier, but I think it is good to have a little longer meditation. As usual, we can get up and have... Firstly, conclude with the last verse. 

> Having established my mind in the center of the bridge, having attained the desired goal of the permanent state, and opening the *cakra* of the palate, may I reach you in the middle path between *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, beyond *Sandhyā*, void of Soma and Agni — the extraordinary, Supreme space — having become *Brahman*. 

So, this is the goal attained by the composer and by the the one who recites this hymn. At the end of the *śrāddha*, if you recite this hymn, you attain the same... you attain the same state. It is very powerful verse. 

"Having established my mind in the center of the bridge..." Now, what is the bridge? What does he say? You know... Towards... I'm just summarizing Kṣemarāja.

> Towards the end, the *Stotra* Garga himself reveals the esoteric goal of this path, which agrees with Kṣemarāja's earlier interpretations. This goal is to attain the center, here expressed as in between the way of the gods and of the fathers. Having become *Brahman* means having attained the uninterrupted state. This is very beautiful, what we are aiming at. 

"May I attain" means, "May I become the Sun of consciousness," the Supreme reality. It's very powerful.

"May I become the Sun of consciousness." Is it you aim of course. 

The Supreme reality: *Para tattvātma-cit-ākāra-rūpa-śūnyam*. So, this is the aim of the one who composed the hymn, and the one who recites the hymn:

"May I become like the Sun of consciousness. The void of Soma and Agni, of the form of unsurpassable space of consciousness, means the state when the inhalation and exhalation have ceased. The bridge, *setu-bandha*, is the center which mediates between the two shores — *prāṇa* and *apāna*, etc. Here, the highest state is again the overcoming of opposites. And, by the yogi... By that, the yogi or *jīvanmukta* becomes a bridge comparable to the image of the boat."

Because there's one... There are two verses where he prays to become a safe boat for crossing. Not only crossing over the ocean of *saṁsāra* himself, but also helping others to cross over. And, this is the kind of a... what is it? The wish expressed in another *śloka*, where he says, "May I come again in this world, and to become a firm boat to help others to cross over the ocean of saṁsāra." So, it's again, it's not only for himself (or herself, or the practitioner, the yogin), but it is for helping others, and for helping everybody to cross over the ocean of saṁsāra.

So, this is really, "Let me become that bridge — Setubandhasya." And, so, the yogin himself becomes that *Matṛkā*. And, if he becomes that Sun of consciousness, that again he can enlighten the whole world. As I have said in the very beginning, that I mean, our Guru has given five ways to get enlightenment, starting from the firefly to the Sun. But, here the aim is very clearly stated, once — he has to become the Sun of consciousness. To *Sūrya*.

"For those who are, of course, the beautiful Hindi translation. But, it was a question of time. For those who want, they can have it." I can copy of... get a copy of this translation by Somayaji.

Is that available online? You have it? Good.

So, I think we have reached a very high stage in that poetic expression of the search for that center, and the center of consciousness, which is the Sun, and the inner Sun, which builts all beings, and with which we can become one in that center. 

So, we have ended a little earlier, but I think it is good to have a little longer meditation. As usual, we can get up and have... Firstly, conclude with the last verse.

So, this is the goal attained by the composer, and by the the one who recites this hymn. At the end of the *śrāddha*, if you recite this hymn, you attain the same... You attain the same state. 

It is very powerful verse. "Having established my mind in the center of the bridge..." Now, what is the bridge? What does he say? Towards... I'm just summarizing Kṣemarāja.

So, this is really, "Let me become that bridge — *Setubandhasya*". And, so, the yogin himself becomes that *Matṛkā*. And if he becomes that Sun of consciousness, that again he can enlighten the whole world. As I have said in the very beginning, that I mean, our Guru has given five ways to get enlightenment, starting from the firefly to the Sun. But, here the aim is very clearly stated — once — he has to become the Sun of consciousness. To *Sūrya*.

Oh, son, you are always established in the eternal, glorious light of Brahman, free from the states of creation, preservation, and dissolution, dwelling in the center of all beings, hidden by nature, but visible in the world, manifesting yourself by yourself like a good master to his disciples. It always brings it down again from the cosmic to the human and to the spiritual. 

*Sarvabhūteṣu madhye*. You are in the... the middle of all, the center of all beings. But that... That energy, that solar energy without which no being will be living. So, you are in the center of all beings. *Sarvabhūteṣu madhye*.

But, then that wonderful comparison with the guru, the relationship of guru and disciples, because... Here, have a little translation by... generation.

> Kṣemarāja explains beautifully on the comparison of the Sun with the guru in relation to his disciples. The Lord is not accessible to the sense perceptions, and is yet present at the heart of all beings, just as a master is manifest directly to his disciples who are recipients of his grace, which arises out of his Self which is self-luminous. He further explains this Self-manifestation of the guru. What he shows to the disciples is the Self, *Ātman*. The reality of the nature of pure consciousness. He manifests himself within as the Supreme Self, and outside as a glorified being of universal form.

So, here the guru is compared with the Sun, who is both manifest and hidden, manifest only to his disciples. And, he manifests the Self, his own Self, to the disciples; and their... their Self, by his light. So, that comparison between the Sun and the guru is very beautiful. 

I have... I think the first... a... obituary I have written after the *samādhi* of my guru was, "The Sun of Consciousness," the title. And, then, I compared him also with the Sun. 

So, this is... again... the Sun, which is in the midst of all beings, and being like a master, showing... that protection, making it directly manifest, that which is hidden.

*Viśuvat* and *abhijit*, again... We have that... that great connection between the cosmic, the spiritual, and the... the two paths — *pitṛyāṇa* and *devayāna*. And the equinox. So, we are at the right time to study this text.

*Viśuvant* and *abhijit*. So... translation... 

> Of the paths, there is the northern course, associated with the cold season — the way of the gods, *devayāna*; and the southern course of the fathers, *pitṛpakṣa* — the dark one, associated with the seasons that start with the rains.

Apart from these two, there is another one. The central course. (There's a mistake.) central course of the equinoxes. *Viśuvant* and *abhijit*, devoid of activity.

> May this state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* be auspicious to me. 

*Kṛtyasūnya*. Again, we have that... that void in between.

So, the equinox, as we said before, is a state of equality of the two halves of the year. And, the devotee (or *Saṁba*, and they say *Saṁba*) — *Saṁba* is the son of *Kṛṣṇa*, who is the author of this *Stotra*. He prays, "Let my... Let my state, or my *Vṛtti*..." (We had a lot yesterday with the... what we learned about that.) "Let my... Let my course... Let my course of action. Or, let my being, or let my activity be in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*." And, here, it is clear that, again like the previous verse, *Prakṛti* stands for *kriyāśakti*, for activity, and *Puruṣa* for *jñānaśakti*, for knowledge. 

So, "Let my state be in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*, in between *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, and that equinox." An equinox is *viśuvant*. An *abhijit* is a mystical term in this tradition. 

Kṣemarāja, you can interpreted... interprets the cosmic time, consisting of the two halves of the year — the northern and southern (*uttarāyaṇa* and *dakṣiṇāyaṇa*) course, in terms of the Yogic breaths. The prayer for attaining a middle state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* is identified with the two breaths, the left and right course. As the two equinoxes (*viśuvant* and *abhijit*) are the cosmic times of the in-between, they are given an esoteric meaning. And, this is important. *Viśuvant*, which is the great pervasiveness, conquers, *abhijayati*, due to the pacification or enduring of duality. And it is such due to its overcoming all. It is *abhijit*. So that *abhijit* means overcoming. It is void of activity of good or evil nature, because its essence is a resting in its own bliss, *svānanda viśrāṇti sāgaravat*.

It's very beautiful. It's again and again, that middle state, whether it's in the cosmic or in the Yogic and the the the times of the year or of the day, that middle state, that *Sandhyā* is full of bliss. It's blissful because it is beyond these dualities. The two courses of the Sun correspond to *prāṇa* and *apāna*. And, what is different of them, the center, *Viśuvant*, *jīvanmukti*. This is all from Kṣemarāja. The state of *unmanā*, the transmental state. 

Again, also *viśuvant* is... _Prakṛti-Puruṣa ke madhye meṁ ṭhere hue be prāṇa-apāna se mukt unmanā-nāmak hui alaukik madhyama vṛtti hai_. So, that transcendental state, which is in Yoga, *unmanā*, the trans-mental, because *prāṇa-apāna*, this duality is always still with the mind. The mind is there. Only in the center, you transcend the mind to that state beyond the mind, *unmanā*. And, where he *mukta sadā keliye prāpto*, that is the prayer. And, _tamī astu vṛtti_ _dvayatapaśamanāt yasya_, pacifying the duality. 

It makes it very pacifying all these dualities — cosmic, the year, the the the the breaths — it are all connected and corresponding. And, the yogin experiences it always in the *vṛtti*, the *prāṇa*. So, this contains of course, a lot of a lot of all understanding of *pitṛyāṇa*, *devayāna*. And, which is very important for the... the, of course, for the rituals for *śrāddha*, *śrāddha*, and connected with death. And so, here, the prayer is to be in that state, in the middle, or in the state of harmony, of the equinox. Neither this nor that, but in between.

*Sambhavapañcāśikā* means literally the fifty verses of *Saṁba*. And *Saṁba* is the author, and the son of Kṛṣṇa, who was smitten by the disease of leprosy, and he was instructed by the Ṛṣis that he should worship the Sun in order to be healed. And this is still alive in Benares. We have a temple under the God to *Sūrya*, where people come for healing from skin diseases. It's very much common. Like in Orissa also. And so, the whole recitation and composition of the hymn, and the end, of course, he is healed. He is completely, not only healed, but also liberated. So, physical healing is only one aspect, but the liberation, which is beyond the physical healing. 

So, this is really, "Let me become that bridge — *Setubandhasya*." And, so, the yogin himself becomes that *Matṛkā*. And, if he becomes that Sun of consciousness, that again he can enlighten the whole world. As I have said in the very beginning, that, I mean, our Guru has given five ways to get enlightenment, starting from the firefly to the Sun. But, here the aim is very clearly stated — once — he has to become the Sun of consciousness. To *Sūrya*. For those who are, of course, the beautiful Hindi translation, but it was a question of time. For those who want, they can have it. I can copy of... get a copy of this translation by Somayaji. 

For those who are, of course, the beautiful Hindi translation. But, it was a question of time. For those who want, they can have it. I can (Make a copy of... Get a copy of this...) translation by *Saṁhitā*.

You have it?

So, "Let my state in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*, in between *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, and that equinox." An equinox is *viśuvant*. An *abhijit* is a mystical term in this tradition. Kṣemarāja you can interpreted... interprets the cosmic time consisting of the two halves of the year — the northern and southern (*uttarāyaṇa* and *dakṣiṇāyaṇa*) — course in terms of the Yogic breaths. The prayer for attaining a middle state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* is identified with the two breaths, the left and right course. As the two equinoxes (*viśuvant* and *abhijit*) are the cosmic times of the in-between, they are given an esoteric meaning. And this is important. *Viśuvant*, which is the great pervasiveness, conquers *abhijayati* due to the pacification or enduring of duality. And, it is such due to its overcoming all. It is *abhijit*. So, that *abhijit* means overcoming. It is void of activity of good or evil nature, because its essence is a resting in its own bliss, _svānanda viśrāṇti sāgaravat_. 

It's very beautiful. It's again and again that middle state, whether it's in the cosmic or in the Yogic, and the... the... the times of the year or of the day, that middle state, that *Sandhyā* is full of bliss. It's blissful, because it is beyond these dualities. The two courses of the Sun correspond to *prāṇa* and *apāna*. And, what is different of them, the center, *Viśuvant*, *jīvanmukti*. This is all from Kṣemarāja. 

The state of *unmanā*, the transmental state. Again, also *viśuvant* is... _Prakṛti-Puruṣa ke madhye meṁ ṭhere hue be prāṇa-apāna se mukt unmanā-nāmak hui alaukik madhyama vṛtti hai_. So, that transcendental... state, which is in Yoga, *unmanā*, the transmental, because *prāṇa-apāna*, this duality, is always still with the mind. The mind is there. Only in the center, you transcend the mind, to that state beyond the mind, *unmanā*. And where he — *mukta sadā keliye prāpto* — that is the prayer. And, _tamī astu vṛtti dvayatapaśamanāt yasya_, pacifying the duality. It makes it very pacifying, all these dualities: cosmic, the year, the the the the breaths — it are all connected and corresponding. And, the yogin experiences it always in the *vṛtti*, the *prāṇa*.

So, this contains of course, a lot of... a lot of... all understanding of *pitṛyāṇa*, *devayāna*. And, which is very important for the... the, of course, for the rituals for *śrāddha*, *śrāddha*, and connected with death. And, so here, the prayer is to be in that state, in the middle, or in the state of harmony, of the equinox. Neither this nor that, but in between.

Now we come to the last verse of the selection. *Sambhavapañcāśikā* means, literally, the fifty verses of *Saṁba*. And *Saṁba* is the author, and the son of *Kṛṣṇa*, who was smitten by the disease of leprosy; and he was instructed by the Ṛṣis that he should worship the Sun in order to be healed. And, this is still alive in Benares. We have a temple, under the God to *Sūrya*, where people come for healing from skin diseases. It's very much common, like in Orissa also. And, so the whole recitation and composition of the hymn, and the end, of course, he is healed. He is completely, not only healed, but also liberated. So, physical healing is only one aspect, but the liberation... which is beyond the physical healing. 

So, this is the last...

> Having established my mind in the center of the bridge, having attained the desired goal of the permanent state, and opening the *cakra* of the palate, may I reach you in the middle path between *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, beyond *Sandhyā*, void of Soma and Agni — the extraordinary, Supreme space — having become *Brahman*.

So, this is the goal attained by the composer, and by the the one who recites this hymn. At the end of the *śrāddha*, if you recite this hymn, you attain the same... you attain the same state.

It is very powerful verse. "Having established my mind in the center of the bridge..." Now, what is the bridge? What does he say? You know... Towards... I'm just summarizing Kṣemarāja.

> Towards the end, the *Stotra* Garga himself reveals the esoteric goal of this path, which agrees with Kṣemarāja's earlier interpretations. This goal is to attain the center, here expressed as in between the way of the gods and of the fathers. Having become *Brahman* means having attained the uninterrupted state.

This is very beautiful, what we are aiming at. "May I attain" means "May I become the Sun of consciousness", the Supreme reality. It's very powerful.

"May I become the Sun of consciousness." Is it your aim, of course? The Supreme reality: *Para tattvātma-cit-ākāra-rūpa-śūnyam*. So, this is the aim of the one who composed the hymn, and the one who recites the hymn:

"May I become like the Sun of consciousness. The void of Soma and Agni, of the form of unsurpassable space of consciousness, means the state when the inhalation and exhalation have ceased. The bridge, *setu-bandha*, is the center which mediates between the two shores — *prāṇa* and *apāna*, etc. Here, the highest state is again the overcoming of opposites. And, by the yogi... By that, the yogi or *jīvanmukta* becomes a bridge, comparable to the image of the boat."

Because, there's one... There are two verses where he prays to become a safe boat for crossing. Not only crossing over the ocean of *saṁsāra* himself, but also helping others to cross over. And this is the kind of a... what is it? The wish expressed in another śloka where he says, "May I come again in this world, and to become a firm boat, to help others to cross over the ocean of *saṁsāra*." So, it's again, it's not only for himself (or herself, or the practitioner, the yogin), but it is for helping others, and for helping everybody to cross over the ocean of *saṁsāra*. 

So, this is really, "Let me become that bridge — *Setubandhasya*." And so, the yogin himself becomes that *Matṛkā*. And, if he becomes that Sun of consciousness, that again he can enlighten the whole world. As I have said in the very beginning, that, I mean, our Guru has given five ways to get enlightenment, starting from the firefly to the Sun. But, here the aim is very clearly stated — once — he has to become the Sun of consciousness. To *Sūrya*.

To *Sūrya*.

Now here again, we have that... that great connection between the cosmic, the spiritual, and the... the two paths — *pitṛyāṇa* and *devayāna*. And the equinox. So, we are at the right time to study this text. 

*Viśuvant* and *abhijit*. So... translation...

> Of the paths, there is the northern course, associated with the cold season — the way of the gods, *devayāna*; and the southern course of the fathers, *pitṛpakṣa* — the dark one associated with the seasons that start with the rains.

Apart from these two, there is another one. The central course. (There's a mistake.) central course of the equinoxes — *Viśuvant* and *abhijit*, devoid of activity. 

> May this state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* be auspicious to me. 

*Kṛtyasūnya*. Again, we have that... that void in between. So, the equinox, as we said before, is a state of equality, of the two halves of the year. And, the devotee (or *Saṁba*, and they say *Saṁba*) — *Saṁba* is the son of Kṛṣṇa, who is the author of this *Stotra*. He prays, "Let my... Let my state, or my *Vṛtti*..." (We had a lot yesterday with the... what we learned about that.) "Let my... Let my course... Let my course of action. Or, let my being, or let my activity, be in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*." And, here, it is clear that, again, like the previous verse, *Prakṛti* stands for *kriyāśakti*, for activity, and *Puruṣa* for *jñānaśakti*, for knowledge.

So, "Let my state in between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa*, in between *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, and that equinox." An equinox is *viśuvant*. An *abhijit* is a mystical term in this tradition. Kṣemarāja you can interpreted... interprets the cosmic time consisting of the two halves of the year — the northern and southern (*uttarāyaṇa* and *dakṣiṇāyaṇa*) course — in terms of the Yogic breaths. The prayer for attaining a middle state between *Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa* is identified with the two breaths, the left and right course. As the two equinoxes (*viśuvant* and *abhijit*) are the cosmic times of the in-between, they are given an esoteric meaning. And, this is important. *Viśuvant*, which is the great pervasiveness, conquers *abhijayati* due to the pacification or enduring of duality. And it is such due to its overcoming all. It is *abhijit*. So, that *abhijit* means overcoming. It is void of activity, of good or evil nature because its essence is a resting in its own bliss, *svānanda viśrāṇti sāgaravat*. 

It's very beautiful. It's again and again, that middle state, whether it's in the cosmic, or in the Yogic, and the... the... the times of the year or of the day, that middle state, that *Sandhyā*, is full of bliss. It's blissful, because it is beyond these dualities. The two courses of the Sun correspond to *prāṇa* and *apāna*. And, what is different of them, the center — *Viśuvant*, *jīvanmukti*. This is all from Kṣemarāja. The state of *unmanā*, the transmental state. Again, also, *viśuvant* is... *Prakṛti-Puruṣa ke madhye meṁ ṭhere hue be prāṇa-apāna se mukt unmanā-nāmak hui alaukik madhyama vṛtti hai*. So, that transcendental state, which is in Yoga, *unmanā*, the trans-mental, because *prāṇa-apāna*, this duality, is always still with the mind. The mind is there. Only in the center you transcend the mind, to that state beyond the mind, *unmanā*. And, where he — *mukta sadā keliye prāpto* — that is the prayer. And, _tamī astu vṛtti dvayatapaśamanāt yasya_, pacifying the duality. 

It makes it very pacifying all these dualities — cosmic, the year, the the the the breaths — it are all connected and corresponding. And, the yogin experiences it always in the *vṛtti*, the *prāṇa*. So, this contains, of course, a lot of... a lot of... all understanding of *pitṛyāṇa*, *devayāna*. And which is very important for the... the, of course, for the rituals for śrāddha, śrāddha, and connected with death. And, so, here the prayer is to be in that state, in the middle, or in the state of harmony, of the equinox. Neither this nor that, but in between.

*Sambhavapañcāśikā* means literally the fifty verses of *Saṁba*. And *Saṁba* is the author, and the son of Kṛṣṇa, who was smitten by the disease of leprosy, and he was instructed by the Ṛṣis that he should worship the Sun in order to be healed. And, this is still alive in Benares. We have a temple, under the God to *Sūrya*, where people come for healing from skin diseases. It's very much common, like in Orissa also. And, so the whole recitation and composition of the hymn, and, the end, of course, he is healed. He is completely — not only healed — but, also, liberated. So, physical healing is only one aspect, but the liberation which is beyond the physical healing.
