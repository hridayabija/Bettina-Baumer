For those who have the text, and we come to verse 49 first, but Śiva will be said alone, and then we'll look.

_Tṛtīya ākāśe nilīnakṣaḥ padmasaṃpuṭamadhyagaḥ_  
_Ananyacetasā subhe paraṃ saubhāgyamāpnuyāt_  
_Tṛtīya ākāśe nilīnakṣaḥ padmasaṃpuṭamadhyagaḥ_  
_Ananyacetasā subhe paraṃ saubhāgyamāpnuyāt_  
_Tṛtīya ākāśe nilīnakṣaḥ padmasaṃpuṭamadhyagaḥ_  
_Ananyacetasā subhe paraṃ saubhāgyamāpnuyāt_  
_Tṛtīya ākāśe nilīnakṣaḥ padmasaṃpuṭamadhyagaḥ_  
_Ananyacetasā subhe paraṃ saubhāgyamāpnuyāt_

I have already let out a secret in my announcement that there are two centers, two _madhyas_. One is the central channel, the _madhyanādī_, and _suṣumnābrahma_; and the other is the heart. And the heart plays a very great role in Kashmir Śaivism. Of course it plays a great role in, uh, in Upaniṣads, and... But here it is very, a very important center again; neither physically nor emotionally, but the heart as the space of consciousness.

And here there is one _dhyāna mantra_ verse which, uh, is very frequently quoted as a meditation on the center, the _madhya_, within the heart. And _madhya_ between what? I already told you that _madhya_ is always between, in between. So in between what? In between two lotuses. It's a very beautiful image which can be wonderfully meditated upon: one lotus opening from below, one from above, and in between there is that space. But what the Upaniṣads also described as space: _hṛdaya_ castle and the heart which contains the whole cosmos, etc. But here it is the two lotuses: one from below, one from above.

So here again, I'll just, uh, read my translation:

> If one merges one's senses in the space of the heart that is at the center between the two halves of the heart lotus with an undistracted mind, then, O blessed one, certainly one attains supreme blessedness.

It's a beautiful verse, and again, every word is so significant. _Ākāśa_; we have all these, uh, important words--I don't like to call them concepts--for space: the open space, the sky, the, the open external space, and then the inner space in the heart. The _ākāśa_ is also in the Upaniṣads a very common term. Then some other kindred words: _ākāśa, kha, vyoman_. And that, that's... And space and very much connected to _śūnya_ because it's only the empty space. And _kha_, _kha_ is another word for _śūnya_, for emptiness, and the opening, the opening. So even the senses, our senses, they're openings. So they are also called _karṇi_, openings. And already in the _tantraveda_... And they're like the doors of our bodies, like a temple or like a castle; and these are the windows and the doors of our senses. There are different, uh, _kha, vyoman, vya, vya_... It's also... All these yogic texts, they are all... They love those words for space: empty space, open space, infinite space. Because, uh, it is that, yeah, that openness, that freedom, in which, as we know, there is the movement in the space of consciousness. And that... We will come to that, uh, depending on the text, but tomorrow with the other element. 

So _nilīnakṣaḥ_: _akṣa_ means eye, but it stands for all the sense organs. And this again, a very, very important practice. Uh, you will... You will find that very difficult. You think it is difficult. That is, all the senses simultaneously. We will come to that in the other texts. So merging all the senses--and _akṣa_ is only given as an example for sense organs, not only the eyes--merging all the senses in that space of the heart. It is a... It is a beautiful meditation. You can, uh, you can practice it. It doesn't require either a great, uh, like in a previous one, state of _nirvikalpa_, or a lot of yogic effort; nothing. But to merge all the senses in the space of the heart. _Tṛtīyākāśe nilīnakṣaḥ_, between the two halves of the lotus. Now what are these two halves? There is, of course, an interpretation.

We have, uh... This also, for the people a little more scholarly interested, we have two commentaries on the Vijñānabhairava. The first by Kṣemarāja, unfortunately, is incomplete. Uh, uh, it goes only up to verse 23. And then, uh, the rest has been commented upon by Śivopādhyāya, uh, a little later, but, uh, a few centuries later. So we do have, uh, traditional, but not sufficient, you know? These are in other texts, we have complete commentaries. So anyhow, Śivopādhyāya, he has interpreted or commented upon these two halves of the lotus, and that inner space, as: the upper... Upper half is knowledge, _pramāṇa_; the lower half is the object of knowledge; and the center in between is the knower, _pramāta_. Now we know that, uh, again the duality of object and subject of knowledge, and, and, and object of knowledge is overcome in the knower. And _pramāta_, the _parapramāta_, the supreme knower, is Śiva. So the center is the knower, is the divine subject; and the upper and lower halves of the lotus are the knowledge and the known. We know that beautiful book by J. Krishnamurti, _Freedom from the Known_. See, freedom from the known means freedom from object-subject uh dichotomy, or knowledge and, uh, and object. So this objective... Things translation already... The change... My just...

> "But he whose mind, together with the other senses, is merged in the interior space of the heart, who has entered mentally into the center of the two bowls of the heart lotus, who has excluded everything else from consciousness, acquires the highest fortune, O beautiful one." 

Now the, the, the condition--and here again you have the brevity of the, uh, Vijñānabhairava--the condition of practicing this _dhyāna_ and of getting its result is _ananyacettā_. Let your mind not waver here and there; _citta_. The mind should not go to anything else. Now any meditation will be useless, of course, if your mind wanders. _Ananyacettā_. And in many of the _dhyānas_, this is mentioned as a condition: if you can focus your mind without going to any other object. _Ananyacettā_. And then the result is very beautiful: _paraṃ saubhāgyam_. Here another Swami has commented:

> "It is, uh, more exact what I have said." 

And yes. And here the commentator Śivopādhyāya, he explains _paraṃ saubhāgyam_--the great fortune, the great blessed-, blessedness, supreme blessedness--as _īśvaratā_, as lordship over the universe, cosmic lordship! It's tremendous! This is the great blessedness coming from that meditation on the center between the heart lotuses without... With an undistracted mind, it leads you to be the master of the universe. _Īśvarat_ that... They connect you with the whole. And, and this is something extraordinary. So there we have the microcosm-macrocosm connection. As we see Marut, the wind, is the breath and the, and the, the elements they are in the cosmos and in the body. And, uh, when you attain that center in the, in the core of the heart, you attain the lotus of the heart. It's a very, very silvery heart, beautiful. 

It's a French translation. We cannot buy... We will not distribute them. And she, it just... And now, not finding... She, uh, expands on this _śloka_ by saying:

> "Once you are in the center of the heart lotus and that space, and that space which is also the cosmic space..."

That's why _ākāśa_. It is the space in the heart and the space outside. 

> "That's why, once you attain to that center, you have attained to the center of everything, of the cosmos."

And this tremendous... This _tanmātra_ so incredible! I mean, how you move from something very interior, very intimate, intimate, to the cosmic, cosmic, uh, space. And the condition, as we have seen, is that you have to merge all your senses within. So not only the eyes. We know from the Kathopaniṣad that that, uh, uh, the Creator has made us with the openings outside; that's why we are always distracted outside. But one particular sage, he came and he turned his eyes within, and then he attained the Self. So it's not only the eyes, it's all senses. It's a tremendous practice, you know? It's, uh, hearing, seeing, touching, uh, tasting, everything. So merging all the senses within that space of the heart, and then you attain that supreme blessedness, _brahma sampatti_. 

Yes, it should not... 

Yes. What is the next...? 

We come to 61 and 62. They are connected. We can recite 61 or 61 and 62 together because they are...

***

_Ubhayor bhāvayoj jñāne jñātvā madhyaṁ samāśrayet_  
_Yogābhyāṁ tvaṁ tyaktvā madhye tattvaṁ prakāśate_  
_Ubhayor bhāvayoj jñāne jñātvā madhyaṁ samāśrayet_  
_Yogābhyāṁ tvaṁ tyaktvā madhye tattvaṁ prakāśate_  
_Ubhayor bhāvayoj jñāne jñātvā madhyaṁ samāśrayet_  
_Yogābhyāṁ tvaṁ tyaktvā madhye tattvaṁ prakāśate_  

_Bhāve tyakte niruddhā cet naiva bhāvātaraṁ vrajet_  
_Tadā tanmadhyabhāvena vikasatyatibhāvanā_  
_Bhāve tyakte niruddhā cet naiva bhāvātaraṁ vrajet_  
_Tadā tanmadhyabhāvena vikasatyatibhāvanā_  
_Bhāve tyakte niruddhā cet naiva bhāvātaraṁ vrajet_  
_Tadā tanmadhyabhāvena vikasatyatibhāvanā_

Now here _madhya_ is directly addressed. You directly practice on any center between two things, two thoughts, and then it gets extended to steps while walking. Uh, of course, two thoughts is a very subtle... Two things is not so difficult.

> Meditating on the knowledge of two things or states, one should rest in the middle. By abandoning both simultaneously, the Reality shines forth in the center. 

It's such a beautiful, clear expression. And here it is a matter of _jñātvā_, meditate. You look at two things and meditate, and then you drop this, the perception of these two, and just enter the center. And it says, "_madhyaṁ samāśrayet_." Rest in the _madhya_. Resting again is to enter into a state, not to do it temporarily and quickly, but you forget about these two things and just rest in the middle. And that is meditation. 

And then you got... But... And simultaneously! See, very often in these practices, this simultaneity is, is stressed. So if you have a sequence: one, this first this, and then that, then this step, the next step, and so on, uh, there's greater intensity if things are done simultaneously. And, uh, very powerful, even in the... With our... What will... Another suitable... Say tomorrow, uh, experiences or practices with that simultaneity. So if you have two things, as Swamiji always demonstrated: this book and that book, and you can see now I drop. I don't look at this book, I don't look... Now, simultaneously dropping the perception of the two, simultaneously, and resting in the center! You got... And then you see in this verse, _madhya_ occurs twice. So it is a very crucial meditation on _madhya_, resting in the middle.

And then when you do that by your meditation, then in that center, in that _madhya_, reality will shine forth. It's a tremendous expression that: "_tattvaṁ prakāśate_." See, we always... Because our perceptions are always colored by our dualistic, dualistic, uh, state of awareness. So once you drop the dualism and to enter into the center, and then in that center the reality shines forth. There's nothing said about what reality, _tattvam_, just the reality. Reality as it is, not as we imagine it to be or as you, you are dependent on this, uh, uh, _vikalpas_. _Vikalpa_ also means a dualistic thought. _Vi_ is always something separate. But is it very clear and as, uh, Swamiji says this is _śakti vaiyā_. It is the wave of energy. It's a wave of energy. It's a wave of knowledge, _jñāna vaiyā_. _Śakti vaiyā_ is _jñāna_. _Jñāna_ means it starts with a perception, then you drop that duality after, in the center, and then in the center, reality will shine forth. It's beautiful, I mean, the actually the promises which this text gives us for the result of this... It's... They're so beautiful: "_tattvaṁ prakāśate_." The reality shines; that's all. 

Then, uh, the next verse is a continu... Continuation of this 61. We have already recited it. 

> "When the awareness has abandoned one object and remains fixed without moving on to another object, then, through the state in between the two, the supreme realization will unfold." 

_Bhāve tyakte niruddhā cet_. So it's a variation of the 61 where you, you normally, um, you direct your awareness to something, maybe a flower, maybe anything, but then just give it up. So there's _tyakte tyaktṛt_, without moving to any other object. So this is not so easy because normally our perception always moves from one to the other, and, uh, always moves here and there, here and there. So abandoning one object, not moving to any other. And then, in that state in between, _tanmadhyabhāvenā_. It's actually moving from something to nothing. And that nothing is _madhya_, that _madhyabhāvenā_. And also the text plays with the multiple meanings of _bhāva_. Now _bhāva_ is a thing; _bhāva_ is also a state, emotional or mental state. So it, it means also, uh, _madhyabhāva_ means you attain a state, mental state, in between, or in that center, in that _madhya_. And the result is "_vikasati atibhāvanā_." Again we had, in the very first, um, verse, the _madhya vikasita_, expansion of the center. And here again, _vikāśa_. And we will come to it in the very end, uh, uh, this expansion. Expansion does not mean expansion; you have the image of a lotus which is closed, which blooms. But it's not something else. It's just expansion of consciousness. So _atibhāvanā_ is the supreme realization.

> "What is the...? I see just one thing. When the mind of the aspirant that comes to quit one object is firmly reso-, restrained and does not move towards any other object, it comes to rest in the middle position between the two. The two... And second is not there, actually. There's only one. And the second is nothing. And through it, it is unfolded intensely, the realization of pure consciousness, in all its intensity. It's _atītabhāvanā_. You know, _bhāvanā_ is a way of meditation, of contemplation, which leads to a transformation. You meditate on something, and you become... You are transformed into that, so-called, object. The object becomes absorbed in your consciousness. The _atītabhāvanā_ is the extreme of... And this is, uh, an intense form of _bhāvanā_. By that state of the center, or inner center. And that..."

You brought this, uh, _bhāvanās_, uh, uh... Sometimes it's very beautiful.

> "...Roam in that center. Roam means, again, that freedom. Once you are in that center, there's tremendous freedom." 

Here, he makes it very clear what is the difference between the three _upāyas_. To identify, identify one _bhāvanā_ with a particular _upāya_. 

> "Some achieve under support of the objective world. It cannot be _anāropa upāya_. _Anāropa upāya_ is when you take the support of _mantra_, you take the support of breath, or of, of _bhāvanā_. When all these things are combined, this is _anāropa upāya_. When God consciousness is meditated upon based on an objective support, that is _śāktopāya_." 

See, um, uh, thought. You start from a thought. You start from a perception from a thought, and then move to that thought freeness. So these are _bhāvanās_ which, which one can practice, uh, as a meditation. You can take it as a meditation. Or practice it in any situation. 

Then we come to difficult words, 68.

***

_Na caittaṁ nikṣipet duḥkhe na sukhe vā parīkṣipe bhairavī_  
_Jñāyatāṁ madhye kiṁ tattvam avaśiṣyate_  
_Na caittaṁ nikṣipet duḥkhe na sukhe vā parīkṣipe bhairavī_  
_Jñāyatāṁ madhye kiṁ tattvam avaśiṣyate_  
_Na caittaṁ nikṣipet duḥkhe na sukhe vā parīkṣipe bhairavī_  
_Jñāyatāṁ madhye kiṁ tattvam avaśiṣyate_  
_Na caittaṁ nikṣipet duḥkhe na sukhe vā parīkṣipe bhairavī_  
_Jñāyatāṁ madhye kiṁ tattvam avaśiṣyate_ 

This is a typical tantric language with the secret, secret language: fire and poison. So, it, it can mean different things, and it is mostly, uh, but mostly not exclusively, of course, applied to the sexual act. It... _Vahni_, _vahni_ is fire. ...is the beginning of the sexual act, and poison is the end of it. Now, of course, this is not the only... Like in any, in this tantric language, you have different levels of meaning. And there are two possibilities. See, in the middle here, because we are concerned with matter. In the middle between fire and poison. Now, Swamiji interprets it, and that's very much in, uh, consonance with the commentary. 

> It also means in the middle between will and knowledge. And to make the mind rest there. _Vahni_ is will, and _viṣa_ is knowledge. So between the rise of sexual excitement and the appeased state of that act. Make your mind rest in between these two states, between the energy of will and knowledge, or between the rise of sexual excitement and its appeased state.

_Smaraṇānanda_. Now, _smaraṇānanda_ is also the sexual bliss, actually. _Smara_ means memory. So, it can be also not the actual act, but the memory of it. The bliss which can arise out of the memory. So where this is starting, this is an ending, and to make your mind rest in between, and that is _smaraṇānanda_, is the, the bliss of the memory. So, this alone. 

Then, uh, Abhinavagupta quotes this in the Tantrāloka, where he says that one should fix one's thought peacefully, _śāntarūpaḥ_, on the substance of fire and of _viṣa_, poison. Or on Śiva and Śakti. So, the actual... In an every sexual symbolism or practice in Tantra is always an image of Śiva and Śakti. So the, the complete, uh, perfect union is Śiva-Śakti. So in between the state of Śiva and Śakti, and one attains the cosmic energy of _prāṇa_, _prāṇā_ beyond inspiration and expiration, as we already had it. And this is the true, uh, bliss of love, united with Śiva. This is from the Tantrāloka translation,

> "Where one enjoys the omni-, all-pervasive, uh, bliss." 

So, here, _viṣa_ is taken in the sense of all. _Viṣa ānanda_: the all-pervasive bliss. Which is, yeah, of a, uh, cosmic, cosmic, uh, bliss. 

Now, of course, there are own commentaries on, uh, on this, uh, tantric, very tantric _śloka_. But, um, uh, now, I don't want to spend more time. You can go back to it, and, uh, but I could not avoid it because it's very important here, this "_cittaṁ matiḥ_," is fixing one's mind in the middle, in the in-between, between this states. 

So, I think we should, uh, come to, to the two more, uh, because these are very complementary, very different approaches to matter. Different ways of experiencing and practicing matter. That's why I give you these examples. And of course, the first is very basic because it has to do with the, uh, central vein, with the _madhyanāḍī_, and, uh, with the overcoming of the duality of, uh, _prāṇa_ and _apāna_. Now, we come to words, uh, uh, 183. 

_Na caittaṁ nikṣipet duḥkhe na sukhe vā parīkṣipe bhairavī_  
_Jñāyatāṁ madhye kiṁ tattvam avaśiṣyate_ 

Now, this _matiḥ_ is applied to all different, uh, areas of life. One is the emotional life. You're constantly shifting between being happy, being unhappy, being suffering, being, uh... So this _sukha-duḥkha_ duality, which is... When we are not stabilized. Sometimes we are very happy, then there comes some bad news, and we become very unhappy. And so that, finding that center between _sukha_ and _duḥkha_. And this is something which we have to practice in life. It's not sitting in a meditation hall, but in life situations. 

> One's mind should neither be engrossed in suffering nor in pleasure. O Bhairavī, you should know the middle state between the two. Then the Reality alone remains. 

Again, as we had it: Reality shines forth. So, it means one should not be a victim of this constant, uh, alternation of happiness and suffering, and this and that, uh, different emotional states. And we know, if you look at any spiritually advanced person, that they remain very stable under all circumstances. So, circumstances of life, they bring us into all kinds of situations. But if you are stabilized, if you are centered, then you cannot be blown over by this, uh, suffering or even, uh, limited kind of joy or pleasure. Say...

> "And knowing the middle state is here _jñāna_. So this _śāktopāya_ is always _jñāna_. You know that middle state, and whenever you come into a situation of one of these extremes, you are in that middle state. And then the result is, again, beautiful: "_tattvam avaśiṣyate_." The reality remains. That which is real. That remains. It's very simple and very universal. Absolutely universal. If you are overcoming this, uh, alternation of your emotions and this and that, and you are established in that center, then what remains is that which is real. It is not the projection of your mind, of your emotions, etc. So it, it is very practical way of living with and beyond our dependence on emotions.  

> So this chapter, by 160... What is it? 126... 126..."

Now, this _madhya_ applied also in our social relationships, in our human relationships. 

> "One should neither feel hatred nor attachment towards anyone. Being free from both attachment and hatred, in the center Brahman unfolds."

It's tremendous! Again, the result is so powerful. _Raga, dveṣa_, of course, is the duality of emotions, that duality of emotions in relation to, uh, other people or even things. So, that... And here, there's a difference between the typical yogic prescription that you have to renounce, you have to give up, uh, _raga, dveṣa_. It's not giving up, but being established in the middle. And that middle is... That _madhya_ is a state of balance. A state of what we have: _samaṭā_. The beautiful beginning of Patañjali's Yoga Sūtra - _samaṭā_ - the goal is to have a balanced state, a state of being neither extreme in the one side nor in the other - too attached or too much hatred or so. So, it is something... Again, it can be applied to life in all its... The relationships with you have. So, it's not just a nice advice, a little moral teaching and so on. No, it's much, much more. Otherwise, you wouldn't say, "_in the middle Brahman unfolds_." So if you are able to be in that balanced state, harmony, which is neither hatred nor attachment. Then... Then here, by this, it's _brahman_. Somebody asked why not _Paramātmā_? _Brahman_ is that all-pervasive, uh, divine or absolute, which is, uh... Its universality accepted from Upaniṣad to Vedānta. It's... _Brahman_ is that universal, uh, divine or absolute, uh, which unfolds. If you are not caught in that duality of attachment, hatred, etc. So the result, as you can see, this text is not just nice instructions - be nice and be, uh, don't fall into this extremes - but the result is always very, very high. Result is, you see the reality, experience the reality as it is, and not depending on your emotions, on your thoughts, on your... So here, _brahma prasarpati_. 

> "What does it say? This _prasarpati_ is very nice. It literally means 'it flows forth.'  It... Either saying... 

> "Aspirant should neither maintain the attitude of aversion or of attachment towards anyone since, is freed of both aversion and attachment, that develops _brahmabhava_, or the nature of the divine consciousness in his heart." 

Yeah. So this was an important complement to starting from the very,  inner experience of _prāṇāyāma_ and the central, uh, vein and the overcoming that duality. But then, applying it to emotions, to, to different situations in life. It's not just for meditation. It is for all... Every situation in life - to find the center. Not to be bowled over by extremes of one or the other. So that... And that practice, of course, you do it in meditation. Being centered or being, uh, established in that center, you have to practice it in meditation. But then, it has to be applied to all kinds of situations, relationships, and emotions, etc. So in that sense, Vighana Bhairava is a complete text, which teaches you  all kinds of, uh, meditations and practices and experiences which are spontaneous, spontaneous, spontaneous experiences which, uh, can lead you to that same state of higher consciousness.  

I think, we have, uh, reached...  

So, these are examples of _madhya_ in, uh, Vighana Bhairava which I... Of course, every time I would request you to go through it again whenever you have the text and you... But then, you pick out one practice or meditation which you can apply and stick to that. So, at least I give you, to, to do one day, you stick to one of these practices, or one of... And then of course, Vigyana Bhairava practices can be applied all throughout because they are very, uh, common to the whole tradition. So, whatever appeals to you most, or what you feel you can practice, you hold on to that particular... For that. 

Now, we have an announcement from Aditi. Yeah. This is, uh, for the groups which, uh, is going to have a kind of review and, uh, the discussion in the afternoon. Uh, the group would be a random. We don't know who is who and what stage. So there should be four moderators.  And, uh, they will give a review, and then it will be followed by the question-answer or the clarification. Okay? So I think, uh, we will put in the number. Maybe Geeta ji, you can say number one. 1 2 3... No, four is okay. Sameer... Sameer is... Okay. Okay, sorry. Right. So this is... These, these four would be the, uh, people who will give the review, and then maybe some of the question that you have in your mind you can post to them. And if there is something very critical question which could not be answered, the moderator will write, and then, whenever there is the opportunity to have the, uh, question-answer session with the, the teacher, I think she would give the answer to that. Okay? Yeah. Yeah.  

And, uh, now we will start one from here. You can say "one."  Three. Maybe loudly. Four. Fifteen.  No, one again. One. Two...  Three. Four. One. Two...  Three. Three. Four. Four. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two.  Three. Four. One. Two...  Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four.  One. Two. Three...  Yeah. Two. Four. Okay, wonderful. So, so at tea time. Eh? At tea time.  4 o'clock?  4 o'clock, 4:05. Yeah. Okay. So where do we meet? Yeah, I'll tell. This is, uh, all number one. All the people, they will go with Geeta ji. And where we are having the meditation. That's the Kando hall. Okay? All number ones. And number two, uh, Micah will go to the dining hall. To Shiva hall. Oh, sorry. Shiva hall will go to the Buddha hall - just down below the Kando. And, uh, the third... The Micah will go to the dining hall. Okay? And the fourth session with Samir will continue here. So the tea time, 3:00 to 3:30. And after that, all of you will go to your respective places for the review and the discussion. Okay? Yeah. Thank you. This is, uh... 

We will conclude with the  _śloka nāma_, is the _maṅgala_ of the Vighana Bhairava. And then, our meditation on the non-tantric meditation is here itself because we combine a little learning of the recitation with meditation. So, we stay here, and anyhow going up it is a waste of time. The other meditations, of course, are all up in the Kando hall. So if you want to get up and move your, uh, legs, uh, before we sit for meditation, you can have five minutes in between. Just to have a little movement after the, uh... 

Just a moment. Let us conclude with the Vighana Bhairava.

_Śrī guruṇāmabhaya prabhavabhayakrandasyā hetu sadodrekhaṁ ni patatya śuciranva rusāṁ hi śūnyakhaṁdakaha hiranyavarttina svayogini vahāṁ tasya prakupitair avad viśvasmin haranādi kṛt vijayate vijñāna rūpaparaṁ_
