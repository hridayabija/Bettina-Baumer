##  Finding the Center: A Retreat into the Heart of Kashmir Śaivism

Paramparastam gahanārthadhanam ekaṃ nigṛhya bhūrurvāsus sarvalayaṃ sarvacarācarastam dvānivaśaṃ bhuvaṃ śaraṇaṃ prapadyate. 

This session has two or three parts. We'll see how much we can pack into the time. One is what is called orientation. So we have to understand the program and the whole... uh... that I'm requesting also Provenza to say something about the... uh... either we start with this or we continue with the introduction for a little bit, and I say something about the content and the method, and then we have some practical orientation from Provenza, and then, as much as we have time, I always want to have some self-introduction, but we are so many, so we can maybe start and then continue some other day because it shouldn't be a monologue. I want to hear something about you as far as we have time. I think let me first say something about the program, the content, and the method, so that this is the other kind of orientation, and then comes the practical orientation. 

So, the general theme of finding this center... And I always will use this Sanskrit word *madhya* because, as you will see in the text which we are going to study, it has a very specific uh meaning, and any translation cannot exhaust that. So, I will use *madhya*. And uh I will also say something about the word... And uh as you have seen from the invitation already, we will follow this topic of *madhya* through different texts. And some very fantastic texts. So, one day, one text. It requires a lot of our concentration. Uh, previously, we used uh only one text for the whole week, but since we are focusing on *madhya*, and we find it in those different texts... There are two tantras: *Vijñāna Bhairava*... And I hope most of you have brought a copy, I hope so... And *Netra Tantra*. And um then there is a very unusual text, *Vātula Nātha Sūtra*. It is thirteen sūtras on sudden enlightenment. You already mentioned uh sudden enlightenment, and this is a text specifically... only thirteen sūtras. 

Then, and I have specifically chosen texts of very different styles also, and there is one poem, a hymn to the Sun, the *Sūrya Sāmba Pañcāśikā*. And how this theme of *madhya* appears in all... all these texts which belong to the Kashmir Śaiva tradition, but which throw light at it from different angles, different practices. And then, of course, with what we had already last year, but not everybody was here, uh the *Netra Tantra*. So, *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra*. And then a more philosophical text by Kṣemarāja, *Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam* - the Heart of Recognition. So, we will probably end with that because he brings it to the culmination point, that whole theme. And so every day will be one text. And um I will do it a little methodically: I give you first an introduction to the text, a brief introduction - what kind of text it is, and then we have the selection, which you have in a little booklet, uh uh of passages directly related to the topic of *madhya*. And then we use the text which we study for our meditation, for our practice. And uh then I give you some guidelines how you can apply it uh for the practice.

Now, first of all, as I have already said in the previous session, finding the center is nothing less than **enlightenment**. But enlightenment can be of so many kinds. And there, Abhinavagupta has a wonderful simile, he says: there are different kinds of enlightenment. It starts from the... the fire... how do you say *khadyota*? *Jugnu* means? Firefly? Fireflier? Ah, firefly. So, it is enlightened for itself, it is a light, but it cannot show the light to others. You can be enlightened for yourself. But you cannot be a guru, cannot be a light to others. So, there's the firefly, then there's a jewel which reflects the light, then there is a star, then there's a moon, and then there's the Sun. So, these are different degrees of enlightenment, where either it's only your own - you are a light to yourself - or you can also be a light to others, and the Sun is the light to the whole world. So, if we have... the Buddha is the Sun. 

And um so Abhinavagupta does it in a very... also a little bit humorous sense, but also to be taken seriously, that we don't have to wait for... now... that the total enlightenment... there are so many degrees, there are so many ways, there are so many stages. And then it all depends on our capacity to receive, and also we believe in Kashmir Śaivism on **grace**. And grace is *śakti*. So, grace means *śaktipāta*, so something which is not in your control but which comes unexpectedly and undeservedly. That is always stressed. Even if you don't deserve it, even if you don't expect it, but suddenly it happens. 

So, finding the center... and I have chosen the word "finding" consciously because it corresponds to the philosophy of **recognition**. It's not something else. It's something which is already there. We only have to rediscover it. 

Then uh I give you some possibilities of how to deal, how to use these texts for practice. Afterwards, we'll talk about the program... uh... why we have arranged it in that way, but it's very important *how* to use the text for our own enlightenment, for our own practice, for our own meditation. 

So, one kind of text gives you **instruction**. And we have many of such instructions in the *Vijñāna Bhairava* that we will do tomorrow. That's the first text, and the one... actually two texts which have led me to the very same... the very topic of *madhya*, that is *Vijñāna Bhairava* and *Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam*. So, in the *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra*, *madhya* plays a very important role, and there it gives you instructions. You... you will see tomorrow you practice with the breath and you... uh... awareness, and all kinds of practices which are described in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*, and which you can take as a basis for your meditation. Not only for one day, but maybe for the whole week. 

So, this is uh instruction. 

Then another possibility to deal with this text is again **recognition**. You read the text... It happened to many of us when we read the *Netra Tantra*, you read the text and you say, "Ah, this is something I have already experienced!" So, you **recognize** something which you could not identify. If everyone of us... that's why we are here. Everyone of us has some experience. But where to place it? Or how to understand it? How to proceed from there? That is why we are going... doing a retreat. So, recognizing, on the basis of a text, your own experience or your own spiritual state, whatever you call it. So, recognition. It gives you a clarity. And this... I mean, I'm speaking from my own experience because I'm living with these texts and they have given me so much clarity, inside experience, uh... So I... I can tell you it is definitely working. So, recognition of something which you have already experienced.

The other possibility is that when you read... encounter a text, that it fulfills some desire or some longing in you. "Well, I have been longing to this kind of experience or to this kind of uh understanding", and you get it suddenly, it gets fulfilled. That longing gets fulfilled. 

I give you a very practical example. And here we have a pilgrim coming just from Kailash. For many years, I have been seeing photos of Kailash in some houses. I could never dream, you know, that I will ever go to Kailash. But photos of Kailash, you know, they have awakened in me a dream - yes, yes, I should have a *darśan*, I should once do that pilgrimage and have that experience directly. And I still remember when, years ago... So, those photos have awakened a dream or a desire, and at some point, that desire gets fulfilled. 

Then uh of course the most direct uh use of these texts is **meditation**. You take any one text, or maybe only a *sūtra*, maybe only a verse, or a word, and take it with you in meditation and stay with it. Stay with it. And then it will do something, whether you have understood it or not. It's not always a question of understanding. This is the beauty of Sanskrit, that you... I have been teaching these texts in Europe, and many people who don't know Sanskrit... maybe many of you don't know Sanskrit... but the power of the language, it leaves some impression. And then that impression, it has a... it has a deep effect. And at some point, you will understand. It's also the traditional way of teaching the Vedas, for example, in India. First, they... this little Brahmins, they... they recite, they learn it by heart, they don't understand. But that recitation and that learning by heart, it leaves such an impression, then later when they grow up, then... and they know the meaning. So, it doesn't mean that we always have to understand. But that even those texts or words which we have not intellectually understood, they have an impact on the mind, and uh they can be used as a content of meditation.

So, there are two phases, of course, you can say a lot about meditation, but this is not just a beginning, to place those texts in a practical context. You can take a text as an **object of meditation** or as something which leads you to **identification**. And actually these are two phases in the *Upanishad*, we will see that. First, you meditate on something, and then you become one with that. And that is called *bhāvanā*. *Bhāvanā* means a meditation or contemplation which makes your words with... makes you one with the object, doesn't remain an object, but you become one with that. And it's often only said that... You don't say *Shiva*, *Shakti*, nothing, nothing... You become one with that. 

And finally, a word or a sentence or a *śloka* can **trigger an experience**. So that is what we have also mentioned uh that something... just... listen. Of course, the ideal is if an enlightened Guru says something which has a direct effect... uh... doesn't need anything more. That what Lila says in one of her books: "My Guru gave me only one word - 'You turn from outside within' - and then I started dancing." So, nothing, only that. She got that word from her Guru, that was enough. So this is uh what we have in all the spiritual or mystical traditions, that uh in any religion or any uh any tradition, that one word can trigger an experience.

So, I have given you one, two, three, four, five possibilities of uh dealing with those texts in a practical way. So, don't take it as an intellectual teaching. That's why it's a retreat, and take the power of these texts in any one of these ways. And then apply it in your practice. And that may be individually different - what appeals to you, what speaks to you at this moment of your spiritual life. And that will be very different in each case. But you have a rich plateau of... how... They offer a big festival of so many dishes, so many spiritual dishes from which you can choose. Not choose - I wouldn't even... I would turn the whole phrase around. You may not find a sentence, a sentence might find you! And that is, of course, grace. That is *Shakti* butter. If the sentence finds you, then you have not to do any effort. But the main precondition is just to be receptive, to be sensitive, to be aware. That the awareness is the basis for all of these practical applications. And then you will see the power of those texts. 

Yes. Now I think we should uh... Yes, there will be also... Yes. Let us first talk about the program. Our uh... From tomorrow, we'll have a regular daily... daily program. Maybe, Shiva, will you say some...? No? I should say, okay. Uh, where's the program? 

So, we have uh, since last year, we have changed the usual program, that the teaching is only in the morning. Two sessions in the morning, very intense, with a tea break as usual. So, you have that intense input. And then afternoon is a bit free, where you can either... you can uh do your own self-study or your own practice, whatever practice you are doing, or then when walking... nature is uh always possible. And there we have to organize because it's a big group, we cannot go all together. So maybe those who don't know the area can have a guide to... to walk with them to the uh very beautiful places in here. And that we'll have to organize it. But the option is there - either you do your own self-study or meditation or practice, or go outside in nature. And then sometimes there is also a possibility to... to visit uh for those especially who are new here to visit the Vaidyanath Temple, which is a very wonderful Shiva temple not far from here. So, the afternoons are flexible. And in the afternoon also, we can also have a session of question-and-answer uh which I don't want in the morning because it needs a whole lot of concentration to... to do the whole morning full with full attention. And you can note your questions, and then at some point we can have a session for question-and-answer. 

Then, of course, the meditation times are on the program. And the only... the noontime meditation will be here itself because they will also do some recitation of the *ślokas* and you will learn recitation, so we need the space. Otherwise, of course, you... will explain them uh where we uh do the meditation in the Ganga Hall and the temple first floor. It will be a little tight, but uh anyhow. I leave it to Pravin to explain uh the situation. 

So, meditation times are on the program. And then the whole question of silence. Now, it is a retreat, and we definitely want to be very focused and very concentrated, and to get some deeper entry into our own experience and uh practice. So, silence is a protection for yourself and for the others. Now, they have a practice in the Rishikesh and the Ashram... if anybody wants to do a very serious retreat in silence, then they put a little label - "Silence". They can participate in everything, but nobody will disturb them. So, I recommend it highly because those participants in my retreats in Rishikesh who were in silence, they have... they profited much more spiritually because they are not distracted. And uh so it is a great uh help if you really want to do it a retreat without talking, without distraction. So, it's... it's an option, it's completely free, left to you. 

Then... So, meditation sessions, and then the whole...
