I hope you are not so filled with confusion, because the first part of the *mangala ślokas*, the *śūtra*, so I give a little summary or survey of what we have done so far. And definitely the *mangala ślokas*, they make it very clear. So if you read the translation again, they give you hints about the whole text. 

First of all, I did not say that there are 13 *śūtras*. So, why number 13? The whole grammar tradition is connected with the number 12. So, there are 12 *kālas* and 12 phases of consciousness. And as in every symbolism of numbers, you know, if you go beyond as a set of a traditional number, it means transcendence. So like you have 36 *śūtras*, the 37th is the transcendent. And so it is very funny because number 13 is very inauspicious in many places of the world. I don't know in India so much, but, so you don't find in the hotel, you don't find the number 13 because people don't want to stay in a room number 13. But precisely what goes beyond the conventional, what goes beyond the uh established norm, and that that is one number higher. So that is why, I mean, it does not say that text that explicitly, but it always speaks of transcending transcending. 

In the first *śloka* already and in the commentary on the second *śūtra* the word *ullanghana* comes. *Ullanghana. Ullanghana* means actually jumping over. So, what do you jump over? Is the conventional religion, conventional society, conventional philosophy, denying everything, denying everything. And because the aim is just to be ready for that jump, that jump uh into the *anuttra*. Now *anuttra* is that which has nothing beyond it. It is that absolute, that uh un-passable reality. But as in the first *śūtra* and also in the the *anuttra* is not mentioned in the *śūtra*. But it is very much in the *mangala* and it's very much in the commentary. So those of you some of you have done uh *pratīśikā vivarana* uh *pratīśikā tantra* commented upon by Abhinavagupta, which belongs to the tradition of *anuttra tantra*. The the yeah *tantra* tradition of the absolute of *anuttra*. So it is also the case here. 

So if you aim at *anuttra*, you have to deny, you have to deny, you have to deny any identification of that absolute with any any quality and that's why denying also all the pairs of opposites. And of course Abhinavagupta in his uh *pratīśikā vivarana* he gives 16 meanings of *anuttra* that uh which includes all this transcending and uh yeah denying any identification with anything particular. So this belongs also to this tradition. 

Now, the uh the whole frame background is as we say, it is *yogine* tradition and the oral uh passing on uh of from *guru* to disciple and from the *yogine's* to the *siddha* to the utter. And the effect of this teaching should be precisely what we are aiming that attaining that void, that *śūnyātā*, that complete transcendent void. They call it *śūnyātā śūnyātā*. Because *śūnyātā* itself can be also a particular void. There are many particular uh aspects of *śūnyātā*. But *śūnyātā śūnyātā* is the transcendent void, which is as I said in the beginning, not a philosophical concept like in Buddhism, but it's purely experiential. But *śūnyātā śūnyātā* is comes very often. But here it is clearly the aim of this uh practice, it's not open us to receive that and to enter into that emptiness. So, that is *śūtra* three. 

### Niśkalānanda Natha's Experience

But before that, I will give you the frame story of the *śrīmaṭ saṅketa prakāśa*. Unfortunately, we have some Kashmiri's here who can also read the Kashmiri but that is only for the present for the footnote uh. So in the *śrīmaṭ saṅketa prakāśa* there is a story of one of the founders of the Kāma tradition, Niśkalānanda natha. Niśkalānanda natha. And he relates how he has made this experience. He has uh received the revelation from a *siddha*. And then Niśkalānanda natha relates that the *siddha's* graceful glance caused him to fall to the ground and a trance in which he experienced the core of consciousness. So, this is the *sahasā*. The *sahasā* is unexpected suddenness and overwhelming uh by of course *guru vaktra gamyam* in the first *mangala* by the grace of the *guru*. So, I just give you uh this account of this experience because we don't have that in our Sanskrit texts. We had it in the Kashmiri. 

> Through the glory of his glance I collapsed on the ground like a felled tree, and in a flash attained the incomparable state that is free of the external and internal faculties, inaccessible to the means of knowledge. This is very important because in all Indian systems of philosophy, you have the *pramana*. You must have a method of knowing reality. But this is inaccessible to all the *pramanas*. Free of effects, beyond the influence of time or its absence. It's *karma* or *karma* is very important also. The uh the normal understanding also in spiritual that there is a sequence, they have to make a progress from step to step and so on. But all this is denied. Beyond the lights of the object mediation, adjacent of cognition, yet pervading them, unlocated neither sequential nor non-sequential, overflowing with the flooding rapture of the ultimate joy of the contactless, beyond bliss. 

So now this is the result. 

> Beyond the means of immersion, immersion is simulation. Free of the errors of ease and is not, free both of conceptual and non-conceptual awareness with a nature that transcends all levels of cognition, free of the stain even of the latent impressions. 

And then after a long time, he is roused by the *siddha* from this rapture, and astonished by what he has experienced full of joy, free from ego, and feeling the emptiness of all the knowledge he had acquired up to that time, he asked the *siddha* to teach him how the state he has experienced can become permanent. Now this is our practical, we experience, they practice, experience, and the main question comes, how can that state become permanent? How can I be always in that state? And this is the this is the crux of the method. Because having experiences, everybody has, but then how to stabilize? How to stabilize? 

> So then start not reading the whole thing. Then he tells, "Tell me, my master, my Lord, how I may perceive at all times completely, on all sides the unprecedented, defectless level so hard to reach that I have experienced by your grace." 

The *siddha* has this very touching moment. 

> The *siddha* remains silent, but casts into the sky a glance which causes the essence of speech to emerge from the highest void and take the form of a *tāvilā*. This is tremendous because, *siddha* that *guru* or the *siddha* does not give a reply from his own. The whole revelation it comes from the *yogine's* from the from the *bītisvarīs* and then to reply to this very fundamental question. He casts a glance to the sky and then he receives that sound. So this is a tremendous uh moment in that dialogue between Niśkalānanda natha and his *guru*. 

> Then that great soul one who remained completely silent, casts the glance brimming with a non-sequential into the depths of the sky and through its power the unlocated transcendental word that is *bandiśvara* that transcends the levels of imminent its eminence to audible speech came forth from the highest void. 

I could it, perhaps I'm not much patient. From the highest void so that voice comes from the *śūnyātā*. And this I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm just reminded of a mystic poet from Orissa, whose poems I have translated and he always says he has received his poems from the *śūnyātā*. To *śūnyātā uhvani*. And we have called that book also verses from the void. Yeah. So it is same. It is this that we mean by a *pūrṇā*, whose nature is unlocated. It has also been called a *tāvilā*, the supreme being who embodies the eternally manifest void who embodies fusion with the radiances of that most extraordinary consciousness, because at that very moment it bestows permanently and in non-duality the supreme wilderness beyond the three lights that is one with that *pūrṇā* free of all observations. *Pūrṇā* of course is the Shakti. 

> Then and this is the introduction to our *śūtra* three. A *tāvilā* points to a manuscript that a *siddha* is showing in his hand and explains that the two boards that enclose it are the two breaths and the two aspects of the goddess, transcendent and imminent. And that he must tear these two asunder and behold the ultimate void, *Mahā śūnyātā śūnyātā* that lies between them as his weird nature. 

And then yes. It goes on. 

> Then he receives that powerful immersion in the state of sudden enlightenment and the same towards *sahasā param*. That is why it is very much connected with our *pūrṇā*. That's in an instant, I experience directly the most transcendent reality and abandoned altogether the snare of learning in its entirety. The wise *siddha natha* who likewise had let go of all the elaborations of false

> knowledge, looked at me and said, "My son, with excellent understanding, you are now worthy to enter the inaccessible great *kāma*." 

That is it. Uh, as a result, I suddenly ascended to the great unfathomed eternal domain of sudden enlightenment. So this is the background story of our *śūtra* three. *Śūtra* three. Sorry. Unfortunately, we have an account of an experience and not just a *śūtra*, which is so compact. 

Now in the introductory uh, text of the *śūtra* three, it says

> *chatiti sarvalangana krīṇēna aniketa aniketa svarūpa prāpti sākṣātkāram mahā sahas ca*

> *chā cha sampradāyam nirūpya idānīm tatrēva sarvavit mahā śūnyatasyēkālē pravakṣate.*

See, it is again and again that simultaneity is pressed. Simultaneity. And this is a model, some practices also about simultaneity in the Viṣṇu parable for example, you experience your body and consciousness as a void simultaneously. That is a very highly advanced practice. 

Now that being said, so the suddenness is always stressed and the simultaneity. So that is one way, you know, that in the nature *tantra* we have heard that they have to overcome time. Uh have to overcome a sense of time because time is that color. Here you have the practical application in the sense of overcoming time in the sense of simultaneity and not depending on the sequence sequential aspect of time and the suddenness. So this introductory sentence after having explained the instruction of the oral teaching of the simultaneity of *prīti prāviṭī*. Now they reveal the *pustaka kṛtā*. So, I will list a long sentence. 

> *iti anāyā ukte pūrvakā*  
> *dūlyakāla nirvanēkṣp̣rēṣaṇ svaṃratanēndriya*  
> *kataṃ upadeśaṃ ukta vā*  
> *idānīm pustakakaṭaṃ nirūpaya yeva.*

Now, this is *kṛtā*. *Kṛtā* we know in Hindi now we have used it also for all this uh, no leg grammar and *mahābhārata* and whatever. But here *kṛtā* means the oral teaching. The oral teaching. So, these are *kṛtā* separate teachings. So after having explained the instruction of the oral teaching of the simultaneity of *prīti prāviṭī*. Now they reveal the *pustaka kṛtā*. They they mention the *yogine's*. Again, not he the *yogine's* again are the legends. 

### Sūtra Four: Attaining Emptiness in the Great Void

Now *śūtra* four. 

> *upāya patṭa utkhaṭṭanām*  
> *mahā śūnyatā pravēṣaḥ.*

By bursting open the two boards one attains emptiness in the great void. And now, because we have heard the story of Niśkalānanda natha, they know that these two boards they are a symbol of the 

*kāma*. What does this symbolīze? This symbolīze *prāṇa apā*, subject object, this actually symbolīzes all the dualities. Now thanks to our *guru*, here we have the tradition of this how the texts are, how the manuscripts are preserved and our even of course the, 

the debate *natha* Sanskrit and traditionally, they are not in a bound book. But they are, this is one board. So, this there's some uh cloths in between. They have one on top mostly and they keep them at the bottom and then at the other end and in between is the *pustaka kṛtā*. It's the book. But here it is with the cloth. But you have another example of so of uh, this is newly made. So the symbolism is that between these two, yeah, this is of course in English. Uh, these are the typical depicting styles I think those who have seen. So the *sangarava mitra* who is the spiritual head of this place, he has decided that all the *śūtras* of Buddha should be translated, which is almost about more than 200 volumes. This is a hundred-year project. It's not for one or two years. And uh this translation is done by the experts, one Tibetan language, one Sanskrit, one English, and of course they should know what Buddhism is. Okay? In terms of philosophy and logic. So, this is the uh a kind of new version. There is the old one because he found that the handling is bit difficult. And uh this is uh one of the checks. You can see on the website also. It is called 84,000. Because it is believed that the Buddha has given 84,000 teachings and uh of course I don't know whether he has given that only for the human realm or for all the *Lokas*. But traditionally it is believed 84,000. So he is translating and this is the format in which he has it brought. Okay? So you can see some of very good translations are there already. I think you explain to about maybe 10 to 15 percent. And any one of you who really feel that you are good in Buddhism and in one of the languages, particularly in Sanskrit or Tibetan, you can write to them. Okay? Yeah. Thank you. 

So the tradition is continued. Tradition of binding uh a sacred text between two boards. And the because the debaters have also developed it to such an extent as a whole and that the artistic uh presentation of these boards with some uh painting or this is also artistic and uh and also some relief carving or, so these boards are very important. And of course, in between you have all the knowledge. You have all the *śāstra*, the the whole text which is contained between between these two. Now, this becomes a

symbol for the duality of the two breaths. The two anterior, so that here. That's what it means, yeah? The two boards, they stand for objectivity and subjectivity. Breathing in and breathing out. Knowledge and action. *Pakāśa* and *vimāśa*. 

This I don't have it in each speech, yeah? Nine. Nine. Yeah. Page 19. Then. Page 19. Okay. Page 19. Yeah. Page 19. Yeah. So and the two aspects of

*Ahāṃ* and *idam*. Uh, which is go, it's subjectivity and objectivity. And uh, so in between these two is the whole *śāstra*, the whole knowledge and so on. But here it is a question of finding that emptiness. So emptying that that whole knowledge. As a kind of denying that whole knowledge which is in between and to enter into that *Mahāśūnyatā*. And this is our *māyā*. So *māyā* is *śūnyātā*. 

And then Swāmi Jī says, "You keep you must have both the boards open, must not close either of the two in any case in order to achieve the real state of God consciousness. Because that will be achieved by keeping both the boards open, clear and alive. To keep open means keep it in view of our awareness. Be aware of both of this, simultaneity again, simultaneity. 

Then here, as of course another interpretation of *Mahāśūnyatā*, uh, let me see this is uh, on. 

In his handwritten, when you burst open the two boards of the senses, of the breaths, of the movements of yeah, of the movements, emptiness in the great fullness takes place. Now *Mahāśūnyatā* can be also uh analyzed according to Sanskrit, *Mahā aśūnyātā*. And I can still remember, uh, Jī, we had a seminar in Sānāt on *śūnyātā* and *pūrṇā*. And Samta Guruji at some point he said, "Well, actually *śūnyātā* is *pūrṇā*." See, what is the difference? And he is, subtly, you know, in that dialogue, between most say, "Oh, they only believe in *śūnyātā*. They only believe in different points." But then Samta Guruji said, "What is the difference?" Because that *Mahā aśūnyātā* is the greatness, in *Mahāśūnyatā*, great void. And here it is a question of entering in that experience which only if you are, only if you are empty, you can experience the fullness. That's the condition. If you are already full, nothing can be experienced, nothing can be added. So it is not a contradiction. It is uh of course what Sanskrit allows you to analyze it as *Mahā aśūnyātā*. 

And the commentary The same attainment of the supreme state, those who *Sanskriti* can follow the commentary. *Pūrṇā* Niśkalānanda natha, very he, the uh, *anāta śakti param* he refers to this story. That's why I read to you. Of Niśkalānanda natha receiving the grace of his *guru*, that *siddha*, who gets brings the answer for my glance into the sky and that's why a *tāvilā* comes down. And uh again, it's the energy. The *ahāṃ*, it's also the highest uh *śakti*, which gives the answer. So the answer don't expect it from any lower level. It has to be that inspiration. That's why we translate also uh, *Mahā sahasā* the great inspiration. 

> The same attainment of the supreme state is here being discussed in detail, as was referred to by the venerable sage, Ganda Madana, in the circumstance of this exhibition of self-composed book, on the occasion he took Gloroś Niśkalānanda natha into his personal favour. The life garden is *prāṇa*. *Prāṇa* is always a flow is branching out into the seven rils finding the wind out in the order of the seven qualities of the senses. The same it's in its full swing represents the upper board. When flowing through the channel of the two cavities, it is called the exhaling breath and constitutes the lower board. Thus in both ways the life breath is coiled by the power of the five senses and shares the functions of the five-rooted serpent. So that is a, it's a five-rooted serpent. A symbolic, symbolic of the five senses. After opening its two coils of waking and sleeping, that is after removing their knot, the centrally situated life breath, that is our *udāna*, reveals itself by the opening of the two boards or by cutting asunder the inhaling and exhaling breaths. The centrally situated life breath is akin in nature to the great vacuity. It is immune from the theoretical stages of *koola* and *ākoola*, that is imminent and transcendent. It is indescribable, supremely manifest, indestructible, and absolutely devoid of the notion of the known and the unknown. It is far above the categories of the colored and the colorless, does not at all come within the province of touch or non-touch. Again all these negations. And is metaphorically called by such terms as ether or space. 

*Anatrāṃśteeri* means the state of unification through immersion in that, the state of unification known as forming the highest teaching manifests itself. 

I must I must 
*tāṭsāma vēśa tāyā saṃrakṣyā śūpyāt* any translation cannot satisfy us. *Tāṭsāma vēśa* and *saṃrakṣyā*. *Saṃrakṣyā* is that fusion of essence. So that fusion which is ultimately the fusion of *śiva* and *śakti*. Entering into that. They call it just unification. 

> *tatrā pāvēśa tat sāmāvēśa tāyā saṃrakṣyā navastitī*  
> *sa evā prāpta mahā upadeśam nāma*  
> *āvidya pāvata ekatyāta.*

Yeah. That state of unification that *saṃrakṣyā* known as forming the highest teaching manifests itself. 

So now we look at Swāmi Jī's uh,

Yeah, we have already seen that he has uh, interpreted these two boards as subjectivity and objectivity and of course the two breaths, *prāṇa* and *apāṇa*. And *pakāśa* and *vimāśa*. Now *pakāśa* and *vimāśa* are the fundamental terms of *tantra* in the light of consciousness, which is *śiva*, and *vimāśa* it's reflection, self-reflection. It is *śakti*. So these are the, again, the two boards. But the task, you cannot even say task, because there's nothing to be done. You just have to let it happen. To enter in between those all those two, all those dualities. And that's your whole awareness or attention has to be in between. So then you say you forget about these two boards and even about what is between them because he says this whole *śāstrī* knowledge, forget about it. So ultimately what remains is *Mahāśūnyatā*. Both the boards and the content. So it is a kind of *dhāraṇā*, yeah you can say it's a *dhāraṇā*. You using this *pustaka kṛtā*, this manuscript as a support for

this visualization and because the reason is that in between these two boards we have all this *śāstra*. So we have the whole computer libraries full of them uh so much of knowledge. So, if in that moment you just let go of everything, let go of all this *śāstrī* knowledge. And then you enter into that *Mahāśūnyatā*. So this is the whole uh you may say, he could have said this thing in a much simpler way, but this is the tradition. And the tradition which comes from this *śrīmaṭ saṅketa prakāśa* from the experience of the great Kāma masters like Niśkalānanda natha was a great master of Kāma who received that from a *siddha*. So, it is not a simple knowledge, it is something which is received from a higher source. And then, it is sudden, it is non-sequential, it is simultaneous. And we just listen to that and then we know, oh yes, that is possible. When it actually happens then you remember. 

### Sūtra Five: Stability in Unlimited Consciousness

And then And then, *śūtra* four. 

> *yūpma grāsā grāsāt nir avakāśa samvit niṣṭhā.*

Māl Bī Here Dr. Barbara, she has she is having a wonderful social and medical center called *Niṣṭhā*. *Niṣṭhā* so that establishment. And this is now the result of the whole process. *Yūpma grāsā grāsāt*. Now *grāsāt* means swallowing or uh, oh, here, uh, we'll have to, it's not so bad. Divāvardeena. Yes. 

By devouring the two, and the two means all dualities. By devouring the two, one attains stability in the unlimited consciousness. Now this is the result of that whole revelation. It's a revelation because it comes from the sky of consciousness. 

> *yūpma grāsā grāsāt nir avakāśa samvit niṣṭhā.*

By devouring the two, means all dualities, one attains stability in the unlimited consciousness. Now, near our *kāma*, is also very a specific term. It's uh, because our *kāma* means also possibility. There so many possibilities and *kāma* is defined as the space for possibilities. We are sitting here in a hall, so we are feeling that space by uh, there so many things are possible by our *kāma*. But this *nir avakāśa*, that nothing else has to be, uh, how to explain it? uh, explanation. So, this, *niṣṭhā*, *niṣṭhā's* establishment, *nir avakāśa's* and with *niṣṭhā*, means establishment in supreme consciousness. Uh, 

Yes. 

> *samvit* universal consciousness on account of being inherently engaged in sucking in all forms of duality like I and this, in going breath and outgoing breath, *pakāśa* and *vimāśa*, knowledge and action, man and woman, right and wrong, devours up all couples of this cord or couples of opposite, simultaneity. When one sucks in all these couples of this cord, then the perfect establishment in that universal consciousness takes place where there is nothing else other than that. This is an *irākaśa*. There's nothing else other than that. 

The whole uh, grammar system or analysis of the phases of consciousness. This is based on the uh, metaphor of food. See, eating, severing, digesting, uh, swallowing. This is all uh so that word *grāsā* also, swallowing. It is and that's why Swāmi Jī always used to say, when he was teaching us, said, "Now you receive that teaching, then you have to digest it." Because digesting is our job. Nobody can go to digest the food which you eat. The same with knowledge. You have to digest it. And so these are phases of consciousness and this swallowing completely the dualities. All the dualities. This is the result of *māyā* having entered into that space of consciousness, which is the center, that which is the center of everything. So find the center between, and then it goes on, that the commentary will go too much into cosmology and so on. That's not our task now. But finding the center between each of these pairs of opposite or complementarities. Then expand it in the limitlessness of consciousness. But it has to be established *niṣṭhā*. 

So this is the kind of the moral the result of this whole uh, explanation and revelation. Finding the center between any two. Expand the center in the limitlessness of consciousness and then make it established. So this is actually translation of the beginning of the commentary. And here, I have Swāmi Jī's uh handwritten translation of the *śūtra* by sucking inside the twofold

> *tāṃmāna prameya tāṃmāna abāṇa kyanā kriyā.*

The establishment in that God consciousness takes place where there is no room of any other agency. So this uh, a little difficult text maybe, but uh, which shows you that from the highest level of consciousness where by spontaneous enlightenment by that powerful spontaneity, beyond time, free from, even free from this limited knowledge and free from all these pairs of opposites. You enter into that void. And then expand that void, and then enter into that space of consciousness. So this is the brief summary of the whole four *śūtras*. 

I think we stop here. I'm sure you have many questions, but not just now. You just adjust it. And then uh, you have a session in the afternoon. And now because you have seen, I think you will agree that this *mangala ślokas* are very powerful and also they contain they contain the whole uh, in a poetic form. So after say five minutes or stretching breaks, and then we come back here, um we learn the recitation. And you can always look at the translation uh alongside. Thanks. It is, yeah.
