##Unveiling the Esoteric Symbolism of the Sun in Yogic Practice

Thisdiscourse delves into the profound symbolism of the Sun in Yogic practices, particularlyas depicted in the *Sambhavapañcāśikā*, a fifty-verse hymn dedicated to Surya, the Sun God. 

### TheSignificance of Equinox

The speaker emphasizes the auspicious timing of the discourse, coinciding with the equinox, a time of balance and transition. This cosmic event, markedby the equal duration of day and night, serves as a potent symbol for the Yogic pursuit of equilibrium between opposing forces.

**Expanding on the Significance of Equinox:**

* **Cosmic Balance:** In many spiritual traditions, the equinoxes(both Spring and Autumn) are seen as times when the forces of light and darkness, activity and rest, are in perfect equilibrium. This balance mirrors the yogi's goal of achieving inner harmony.
* **Transition and Transformation:**The equinoxes also mark periods of transition - a shift from one season to another. For the yogi, this represents the ongoing journey of spiritual transformation, moving from a state of duality to one of unity.
* **Auspiciousness:** Due to this unique energetic alignment, the equinoxes are considered highly auspicious forspiritual practices, enhancing meditation and facilitating deeper connection with the divine.

### Verse 25: The Central Channel and the Nature of Truth

> The yogin who enters or merges in the central inner rising *prāṇa* in between the eternal and the temporary — It's one pair I have left outin my explanation — in between the eternal and the temporary. So it's neither only temporal nor only eternal but in between. In between the eternal and the temporary, which is ever flowing in the form of exhalation and inhalation. In between Agni and Soma, in the form of swallowing or consuming and nourishing. Thatis the two qualities of Agni and Soma.

The discussion commences with an analysis of verse 25, focusing on the significance of the "central inner rising *prāṇa*," a concept intricately linked to the Sushumna Nadi, the central energy channel in Yogic anatomy. This *prāṇa*, existing between the eternal and temporary, is symbolic of the yogi's transcendence of duality.

**Deep Dive into the Central Channel and the Nature of Truth:**

* **Sushumna Nadi:** In yogic philosophy, *prāṇa*, the vital life force, flows through subtle energy channelscalled *nadis*. The Sushumna Nadi is the most important of these, running along the spine from the base to the crown of the head. It is often depicted as the central channel, flanked by Ida (lunar) and Pingala (solar) nadis.
* **Transcending Duality:**When the yogi, through practices like *prāṇāyāma* (breath control), activates and accesses the Sushumna Nadi, they transcend the limitations of duality represented by the pairs of opposites mentioned in the verse.
* **Eternal and Temporary:** This refers to the unchanging, eternal nature of the Self(Atman) and the constantly changing phenomenal world (Maya). The yogi, established in the Sushumna Nadi, experiences both simultaneously, recognizing the illusion of separateness.

Further elaborating on this theme, the speaker explores the concept of truth and falsehood, not as rigid absolutes, but as manifestations ofconsciousness. Truth (*Vikāsa*) is associated with the expansion of consciousness, while falsehood (*Saṁkucita*) represents its contraction. The yogi's journey, therefore, becomes a quest for expanded awareness.

* **Truth as Expansion, Falsehood as Contraction:** This concept emphasizes the dynamic natureof truth. It's not merely about factual accuracy but about the depth and breadth of our awareness. Limiting beliefs, negative thought patterns, and attachments constrict consciousness, leading to a distorted perception of reality (falsehood). Conversely, cultivating openness, self-awareness, and compassion expands our consciousness, allowing for a greaterunderstanding of truth.

The verse proceeds to depict this "in-between" state through a series of dualities, including:

* **Agni and Soma**: Representing the consuming and nourishing aspects of existence. 
 * **Agni** is the fire principle associated with transformation, metabolism, and will.* **Soma** is the lunar principle associated with peace, nourishment, and bliss.
* **Prakṛti and Puruṣa**: Symbolizing the dynamic interplay between the material world (*Prakṛti*) and pure consciousness (*Puruṣa*).
 * **Prakṛti** is the primordial nature, the source of all manifest forms and phenomena.
 * **Puruṣa** is the pure consciousness, the unchanging witness of Prakṛti's dance.
* **Bindu and Nada**: Representing the polarities of experience and reflection.
 * **Bindu**is the point, the source, the potential from which all manifestation arises. 
 * **Nada** is the sound, the vibration, the manifestation itself.
* **Day and Night**: Signifying the cycles of activity and repose.
 * In addition to their literal meaning, they also symbolize the cyclesof birth and death, creation and dissolution.
* **Truth and Falsehood**: As explained earlier, these represent expansion and contraction of consciousness.
* **Righteousness (*Dharma*) and Unrighteousness (*Adharma*)**: Depicting the upward and downward movements of the soul.
 ***Dharma**, often translated as "righteous living," aligns us with our true nature and propels us towards liberation. 
 * **Adharma**, acting against our true nature, keeps us bound to the cycle of suffering. 
* **Being and Non-Being**: Alluding to the manifestationand unmanifestation of reality.
 * This refers to the cyclical nature of the cosmos, where manifestation emerges from the unmanifest, and eventually dissolves back into it.

The yogin, by merging with the central *prāṇa*, transcends these dualities and unites with the "Supreme Sun beyond qualities,"attaining a state of pure, undifferentiated consciousness.

### The Yogic Interpretation of Day and Night

> And here we have that beautiful — again, what is day and what is night spiritually? Day, according to this tradition... or some... Those were fully awakened. Some of them touch. And the day illuminatedby the light of reality, or those who have entered the Yogic sleep in the night of the quieting of the mind, *cittopaśama*, having pierced through the light of the Sun at the junctures between day and night, full of Supreme bliss, they attained the Supreme state of *Nirvāṇa*. This is a tremendous verse. It's not as difficult as the previous ones. And it's very clear.

The discussion then shifts to the Yogic interpretation of day and night. In this context, day signifies a state of enlightenment (*Sattva dina*), illuminated by the light of true reality. This state can be attained through constant awareness and the direct experience of truth.

* **Sattva Dina:** *Sattva* refers to the quality of purity, harmony, and balance, while *dina* means "day." So *Sattva Dina* is not just the period when the sun is out, but a state of being where the light of wisdom illuminates the yogi's consciousness, dispelling ignorance.

Night, on the other hand, represents the state of *cittopaśama*, the quieting of the mind. This is not ordinary sleep, but a state of deep inner stillness achieved throughmeditation and yogic practices.

* **Cittopaśama:** *Citta* refers to the mind-stuff, the field of thoughts and emotions. *Upaśama* translates to "quieting" or "calming." This doesn't mean the mind becomes blank, but thatit becomes still, like a calm lake reflecting the sky clearly. This state allows for deeper introspection and connection with the true Self.

### Sandhyā: The Blissful Juncture

The speaker introduces the concept of *Sandhyā*, a Sanskrit term signifying the junctures between day and night—dawn anddusk. These transitional periods are considered highly potent and are traditionally dedicated to spiritual practices.

* **Sandhyā as Sacred Thresholds:** In ancient Indian traditions, *Sandhyā* times were seen as sacred thresholds, moments when the veils between the physical and spiritual realms were thin. This is why rituals,prayers, and meditation are often performed during dawn and dusk.

In a Yogic context, *Sandhyā* represents the point where the awakened state of enlightenment (*Sattva dina*) meets the tranquil state of mental quietude (*cittopaśama*). It is in these moments of perfect balance, whereduality dissolves, that the yogi experiences supreme bliss (*Parama-nandasaṁdhyā*).

* **The Bliss of Balance:** *Parama-nandasaṁdhyā* highlights the blissful state achieved through transcending the limitations of duality. When the active, outward-focused energy of "day" merges with the receptive, inward-focused energy of "night," a state of perfect equilibrium and bliss arises.

### Piercing Through the Physical Sun to Attain Liberation

> Only by when you pierce through the physical light, that you attain that Supreme light, which is *Nirvāṇa*, which isliberation.

The discourse further reveals that achieving liberation (*Nirvāṇa*) requires "piercing through" the light of the physical sun. This metaphorical act signifies transcending the limitations of the material realm and accessing the infinite, spiritual light beyond. 

* **The Sun as a Symbol:** The physical sun, while essentialfor life, is still part of the manifested world (Maya). To attain liberation, one must go beyond the limitations of form and perception, even the perception of light as we know it.

The speaker draws parallels with the *Iśopaniṣad*, where the dying person envisions a golden disk, representingthe Sun, and attains liberation by merging with this divine light.

* **The Golden Disk:** In the *Iśopaniṣad*, the golden disk symbolizes the radiant Self (Atman). Death is described as the merging of the individual consciousness with this divine light.

Kṣemarāja,a renowned commentator on Kashmir Shaivism, explains that the physical light, being limited (*Saṁkucita prakāśam*), must be transcended to reach the absolute, unlimited light of pure consciousness. This spiritual light, described as the "Supreme light-filled abode of energy" (*paraṁ śaktam tama*), signifies liberation while living (*jīvanmukti*).

* **Saṁkucita prakāśam:** *Saṁkucita* means "contracted" or "limited," while *prakāśam* refers to "light." So, the physical light, whileseemingly vast, is limited compared to the infinite light of consciousness.
* **Paraṁ śaktam tama:** *Paraṁ* means "supreme," *śaktam* refers to "power" or "energy," and *tama* can mean "darkness" or "abode." This seemingly paradoxical phrasepoints to the ultimate reality being beyond our usual conceptions of light and darkness, an abode of infinite power and potential.
* **Jivanmukti:** *Jivan* means "life" and *mukti* means "liberation." *Jivanmukti* is the state of liberation achieved while stillliving in the physical body, characterized by freedom from suffering and the realization of one's true nature.

### The Two Paths: Devayāna and Pitṛyāṇa

The speaker introduces the concepts of *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa*, the two paths described in Hindu cosmology. *Devayāna*, the "path of the gods," is associated with the northern course of the sun and represents the path to liberation. *Pitṛyāṇa*, the "path of the fathers," is linked to the southern course of the sun and represents the cycle of birth and death.

* **Solar Symbolism:**The paths of *devayāna* and *pitṛyāṇa* are often linked to the sun's journey northward (Uttarayana) and southward (Dakshinayana). Uttarayana, considered auspicious, is associated with spiritual ascent and liberation, while Dakshinayana is associated with the descent intothe material realm and the cycle of reincarnation.

The equinox, representing a point of balance between these two paths, becomes highly significant. It is a time when the yogi can choose to transcend the cycle of *saṁsāra* (conditioned existence) and embark on the path of liberation.

* **ChoosingLiberation:** The equinox becomes a powerful metaphor for the choice point we face in our spiritual journey. We can remain bound to the cyclical nature of *saṁsāra*, or, through dedicated practice and self-realization, we can choose to walk the path of liberation.

### Sambhavapañcāśikā: The Hymn of Healing and Liberation

> *Sambhavapañcāśikā* means literally the fifty verses of *Saṁba*. And *Saṁba* is the author, and the son of *Kṛṣṇa*, who was smitten by the disease of leprosy, and hewas instructed by the Ṛṣis that he should worship the Sun in order to be healed.

The discourse then delves into the story behind the *Sambhavapañcāśikā*. It narrates the tale of Samba, the son of Krishna, who was afflicted with leprosy. On the adviceof sages, Samba performed rigorous penance and worshiped Surya, the Sun God, to be cured. His devotion led to not only physical healing but also spiritual liberation.

* **Healing on Multiple Levels:** Samba's story highlights the multi-dimensional power of spiritual practice. While his initial goal was to curehis physical ailment, his sincere devotion and surrender to Surya led to a much deeper transformation, culminating in spiritual liberation. This story exemplifies how healing can occur on physical, mental, and spiritual levels.

### The Yogi as a Bridge: Setubandhasya

> Let me become that bridge - *Setubandhasya*. And so, the yogi himself becomes that *Matṛkā*. And, if he becomes that Sun of consciousness, that again, he can enlighten the whole world.

The final verse of the selection reveals the ultimate aspiration of the yogi — to become a bridge (*Setubandhasya*)guiding others towards enlightenment. This transformation signifies the yogi embodying the *Matṛkā*, the divine creative energy, and becoming a beacon of light, like the Sun, illuminating the world with wisdom and compassion.

* **From Individual to Universal:** The image of the bridge beautifully illustrates the shift in perspective that occurs onthe spiritual path. Initially, the focus might be on individual liberation, but as one progresses, the yearning to help others awaken arises naturally. The yogi, established in their own realization, becomes a conduit for divine grace, guiding others across the ocean of suffering.
* **Matṛkā:** This term refers tothe divine feminine energy, the source of creation and manifestation. By embodying *Matṛkā*, the yogi aligns with the universal creative force, becoming a channel for divine energy to flow through.

The speaker highlights the importance of this selfless aspect of the yogic path. It is not enough to seek personal liberation;the true yogi strives to alleviate the suffering of all beings, helping them cross the ocean of *saṁsāra*.

* **Bodhisattva Ideal:** This concept is similar to the Bodhisattva ideal in Mahayana Buddhism, where a being, upon reaching enlightenment, vows to guide all sentient beings to liberation beforeattaining their own final Nirvana.

### The Sun as Guru

> Kṣemarāja explains beautifully on the comparison of the Sun with the guru in relation to his disciples. The Lord is not accessible to the sense perceptions, and is yet present at the heart of all beings, just as a master is manifest directlyto his disciples who are recipients of his grace, which arises out of his Self which is self-luminous.

The discourse concludes with a beautiful analogy, comparing the Sun to a true Guru. Just as the Sun nourishes and sustains all beings, a Guru illuminates the path to enlightenment. Both are ever-present, yet their true nature remains hidden from those who are not ready to receive their grace.

* **Inner and Outer Guru:** This analogy highlights the concept of the Guru being both external (a realized teacher) and internal (the divine principle residing within). Just as the physical sun guides and nourishes us externally, theinner Guru, the divine spark within, guides us towards self-realization.

The Guru, like the Sun, reveals the Self (*Ātman*) to the disciple, guiding them towards the realization of their true nature. This relationship, based on grace and surrender, is essential for spiritual awakening.

* **Grace and Surrender:** The Guru-disciple relationship is considered sacred in many traditions. It is not merely a teacher-student dynamic but a transmission of wisdom and energy based on deep trust, surrender, and grace. The disciple surrenders to the Guru's guidance, while the Guru, through their own realization,awakens the disciple's inner wisdom.

The speaker concludes by urging the audience to meditate on these profound teachings, to connect with the inner Sun of consciousness, and to embody its radiant, life-giving energy.

* **The Inner Sun:** The discourse encourages us to shift our attention inward, to connect withthe "Sun" residing within our own hearts. This inner Sun, representing pure consciousness, is always shining, even when obscured by the clouds of ignorance. Through yogic practices, meditation, and self-inquiry, we can dispel these clouds and bask in its radiant light.
