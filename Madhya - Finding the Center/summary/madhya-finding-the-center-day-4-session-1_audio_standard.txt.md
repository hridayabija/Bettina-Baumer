## A Deep Dive into the Heart of *Madhyā*

This insightful discourse offers an exploration of *madhyā*, a Sanskrit term often translated as "the center" or "in between," within the framework of Kashmir Śaivism and yogic practices. Drawing upon a hymn to Sūrya, the Sun god, and commentaries by Kashmiri Śaiva masters, the speaker unveils the profound significance of *madhyā* as a principle that transcends dualities and leads to spiritual liberation.

### The Significance of the *Sūrya-stotra*

The chosen text for this exploration is a hymn dedicated to Sūrya, the Sun god. While seemingly a devotional song praising a deity, the hymn, titled *Sūrya-stotra*, transcends its literal interpretation, delving into the esoteric realm of Kashmir Śaivism.

* **Sūrya as *Cit-bhānu***: The commentary by *Kṣemarāja*, a prominent figure in the lineage of Kashmir Śaivism and a disciple of the renowned master *Abhinavagupta*, identifies Sūrya with Śiva, the Supreme Consciousness. This identification is not arbitrary but rooted in the tradition's understanding of the divine as omnipresent and manifesting in various forms. 
   
    * **Sūrya, the Manifestation of Consciousness**: Sūrya, as the source of light and life in the physical world, becomes a potent symbol for the light of consciousness that illuminates our inner world.  Sūrya is not merely a celestial body but a symbol of *cit-bhānu* or *cit-arka*, the "Son of Consciousness," representing the ultimate reality that pervades and transcends all phenomena. 

* **Two Levels of Interpretation**: *Kṣemarāja* employs a two-tiered hermeneutic approach to the hymn, reflecting the non-dualistic philosophy of Kashmir Śaivism. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of the outer and inner realms. 

    * **The Cosmic Level**: The first level interprets Sūrya in the cosmic sense, acknowledging its physical and astronomical attributes. This level appreciates the order and beauty of the natural world as a reflection of the divine order.
    * **The Esoteric Level**: The second, more profound level delves into the esoteric or *rahasya-artha*, unveiling Sūrya as the Sun of Consciousness residing within every being (*antar-ātman*). This inner Sun, the true Self, becomes accessible through yogic practices that aim to quiet the fluctuations of the mind and reveal the inherent luminosity of consciousness. This level invites the practitioner to move beyond the external forms and connect with the inner divinity.

### Exploring Key Verses

Several verses from the *Sūrya-stotra* are analyzed to elucidate the concept of *madhyā*. 

#### The Inner Sun and the Yogic Body (Verse 5)

> Make the pure white image of the Supreme Āditya—who has entered in between the upper and lower worlds—be propitious unto us.
> That Sun who dwells between all beings—having entered all the manifold veins, is verily the *pramāṇādi* which is attained by the *yogins* who are engaged in absorbing the inhalation and exhalation between the two.

This verse highlights the intimate connection between the macrocosm and the microcosm, a recurring theme in yogic and tantric traditions.

* **The Inner Sun (*Antarasthita*)**:  The verse emphasizes that Sūrya, as the inner Sun, is not separate from us but resides within (*antar-sthita*).  This concept of an indwelling divinity is central to many spiritual traditions. 
     
    * **The Network of *Nāḍīs***:  The verse mentions *nāḍīs*, which are subtle energy channels within the yogic body. These *nāḍīs* are pathways for *prāṇa*, the vital life force, to flow. Sūrya, as the source of *prāṇa*, is said to permeate these channels, illuminating the entire being.

* **The Significance of *Prāṇa* and *Apāna***:  The verse emphasizes the yogic practice of focusing on the breath, a fundamental technique called *prāṇāyāma*. *Prāṇa*, often translated as "breath," is the vital life force inhaled, while *apāna* is the downward energy flow exhaled. They represent a fundamental duality within the subtle body.
    
    * **Finding the *Madhyā* in the Breath**: The *yogin* seeks to find the *madhyā* between these two, the point of stillness and balance where the breath naturally suspends. This point is not merely a physical sensation but a gateway to deeper states of consciousness.

* **Experiencing the *Brahmāṇḍi***:  Through *prāṇāyāma* and other yogic practices, the *yogin* attains the *brahmāṇḍi*. This term refers to the central channel, also known as *suṣumnā*, which runs along the spine. It is the microcosmic equivalent of the Sun's principal ray, highlighting the correspondence between the inner and outer cosmos. 

    * **The Awakening of *Kuṇḍalinī***: The *brahmāṇḍi* is also the pathway for *kuṇḍalinī*, the dormant spiritual energy, to rise.  As the *yogin* establishes themselves in the *madhyā* of the breath, they create the conditions for *kuṇḍalinī* to awaken and ascend through the *brahmāṇḍi*, leading to spiritual transformation.

#### The Protective Power of *Bhakti* (Verse 18)

> She is like the Goddess Śrī in the house, like *kāmadhenu* in a foreign place, like a torch in darkness, like fearlessness in a forest, like the central vein (*brahmāṇḍi*) in *yoga*. And in the ocean of *saṃsāra*, full of the crocodiles of the various sense objects, she is like a saving boat. May I reach your Supreme Immortality, which is neither cold nor hot. 

This verse beautifully illustrates the protective and guiding power of *bhakti*, devotion, a concept often emphasized in the path of Kashmir Śaivism.

* ***Bhakti* as a Constant Companion**: *Bhakti*, often translated as "devotion," is more than mere faith or belief. It is a deep feeling of love and surrender to the divine, which in this context is represented by Sūrya, the embodiment of consciousness. The verse personifies *bhakti* as a feminine presence who offers solace and support in various situations. This personification highlights the nurturing and comforting aspects of devotion.

    * **Śrī in the House**: Within the home, she embodies prosperity, happiness, and beauty, represented by the goddess Śrī. Here, *bhakti* brings harmony and abundance to the domestic sphere.
    * **Kāmadhenu in a Foreign Land**:  In unfamiliar territory, where one feels alone and vulnerable, she becomes *kāmadhenu*, the wish-fulfilling cow from Hindu mythology, providing sustenance and fulfilling needs. This metaphor speaks to the capacity of *bhakti* to provide comfort and support in challenging situations.
    * **A Torch in Darkness and Courage in the Forest**: She dispels fear and ignorance, offering guidance and protection.  In moments of doubt and confusion, *bhakti* illuminates the path forward, giving the individual courage to face the unknown.

* ***Bhakti* and *Yoga***: Importantly, *bhakti* is crucial for yogic practice.  The verse states that in *yoga*, she manifests as the *brahmāṇḍi*, the central channel. This connection highlights the importance of devotion in the yogic path. While many associate yoga primarily with physical postures and breath control, Kashmir Śaivism emphasizes the indispensable role of *bhakti* in achieving higher states of consciousness.

    * **Uniting with the Divine**: *Kṣemarāja* explains that this *bhakti*-infused *brahmāṇḍi* is what leads to the union (*yojanā*) with the Supreme Śiva (*parasivātmaikya-āveśa*), emphasizing the role of devotion in achieving spiritual liberation.  Through *bhakti*, the *yogin*'s heart and mind become aligned with the divine, facilitating the union of the individual consciousness with the Supreme Consciousness.

* **Navigating *Saṃsāra***: The verse uses the powerful image of *saṃsāra*, the cycle of birth and death, as a vast ocean filled with dangers.  Just as a boat helps navigate treacherous waters, *bhakti* acts as a vessel guiding the individual across this turbulent ocean. It provides a sense of purpose and direction, preventing the individual from being swept away by the currents of desire and attachment. The "crocodiles" represent the distractions and attachments of the material world, which *bhakti* helps the individual to overcome. 

####  The *Yogin* and the Pairs of Opposites (Verse 20)

> The *yogin* who enters within the pairs of opposites, such as *agni* and *soma*, *prakrti* and *puruṣa*, *bindu* and *nāda*, *prāṇa* and *apāna*, day and night, truth and falsehood, *dharma* and *adharma*, reality and unreality, which are ever-present, being free from them in his mind, remains within himself. He enters in you who are free from qualities. 

This verse stands as a cornerstone in understanding *madhyā*. It presents a catalog of dualities and highlights the *yogin*'s path of transcending them.

* **Embracing the Duality**: The verse lists several fundamental dualities that shape our experience of existence:

    * ***Agni* and *Soma***: Fire and Moon, representing the active and passive forces in the cosmos and within the yogic body as *prāṇa* and *apāna*. These polarities represent the masculine and feminine principles that govern creation.
    * ***Prakṛti* and *Puruṣa***:  The fundamental duality in Sāṃkhya philosophy, one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, representing matter and consciousness, respectively. This duality highlights the interplay between the material world and the conscious observer.
    * ***Bindu* and *Nāda***:  The point and the sound, symbolic of the creative potential (*bindu*) and its manifestation (*nāda*). This duality points to the dynamic nature of reality, constantly flowing from potentiality into manifestation.
    * **Day and Night**: The cyclical nature of time and the interplay of activity (day) and rest (night). This duality reflects the rhythms inherent in both the natural world and human experience.
    * **Truth and Falsehood, *Dharma* and *Adharma***:  The ethical and moral dilemmas inherent in human existence. This duality highlights the choices we face and the importance of aligning our actions with our highest understanding of truth and righteousness.
    * **Reality and Unreality**: The philosophical question of the nature of existence itself. This duality points to the limitations of our perception and the challenge of discerning true reality from illusion.

* **Finding the *Madhyā***:  The *yogin*, through dedicated practice, learns to perceive these dualities not as separate, opposing forces but as interconnected aspects of a unified reality. They do not seek to negate or choose one side over the other. Instead, they strive to find the *madhyā*, the center point between these opposing forces, recognizing the inherent unity that underlies apparent duality. This process requires a shift in perspective: 

    * **From Either/Or to Both/And**:  It is a movement away from the limitations of binary thinking, which often creates division and conflict, towards a more holistic understanding that recognizes the interconnectedness of seemingly opposite concepts. This shift in perspective is essential for realizing the non-dual nature of reality.

* **Transcendence and Liberation**:  By dwelling in the *madhyā*, the *yogin* experiences liberation from the pull of dualities, which often bind us to suffering and limitation. They attain a state of *nirguṇa*, free from the limitations of qualities, similar to the Buddhist concept of *śūnyatā*, emptiness or voidness.  This *nirguṇa* state is not a state of nothingness but a state of pure consciousness, free from all attributes and limitations. It is the state of the divine, symbolized by the Sun, which transcends all dualities and shines its light equally on all.

#### The Significance of *Viṣuvat* (Verse 35)

> O Lord, *agni* and *soma* are the causes of the whole world. By your rays, you create their emission and withdrawal in the order of decrease and increase. You lead the two equally in the inner juncture, *viṣuvat*, offering them in the fire of the self. And you dissolve them in an instant to give liberation to your devotees. 

This verse brings together the cosmic and the yogic, emphasizing the importance of balance and equanimity represented by the concept of *samatā*.

* **Cosmic Balance**: The verse uses the imagery of *viṣuvat*, the equinox, to illustrate the concept of balance. Just as the equinox marks a point of equilibrium between day and night, where they are of equal length, the *yogin* seeks to find balance between opposing forces within. This balance is not a static state but a dynamic equilibrium achieved through mindful awareness.

* **The Fire of the Self**:  The verse mentions offering *agni* and *soma* into the "fire of the self" (*cūpodāmātmana nau*). This fire is not to be taken literally but represents the transformative power of *udāna*, the upward-moving breath, which is activated when *prāṇa* and *apāna* are balanced.  This *udāna* is often associated with the element of fire, as it is the force that propels our energy upward, towards higher states of consciousness.

    * **Transformation Through Balance**: When *agni* and *soma*, the dualistic forces within, are offered into this inner fire, they are not destroyed but transformed and unified. This process of unification through the fire of *udāna* leads to liberation from the limitations of duality.

### Conclusion: Embracing *Madhyā* in Daily Life

The discourse concludes with a call to action, encouraging listeners to incorporate the principle of *madhyā* into their daily lives.  This integration moves the concept of *madhyā* from a theoretical understanding to a lived experience.

* **Meditation and Contemplation**:  Individuals are encouraged to meditate on the pairs of opposites presented in the verses, finding the center point between them.  This meditation is not about forcing the mind into a blank state but about cultivating a mindful awareness of the arising and passing of thoughts, emotions, and sensations without judgment or attachment. By observing these dualities with equanimity, the meditator naturally begins to perceive the *madhyā*, the stillness and silence that underlies all phenomena.
* **A Path to Healing and Wholeness**:  Embracing *madhyā* offers a path to healing the divisions within ourselves and the world around us. It allows for a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of reality, free from rigid judgments and dualistic thinking that often lead to conflict and suffering.  By recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and finding the center within, we cultivate greater peace within ourselves and extend that peace outwards, contributing to a more harmonious and compassionate world.
