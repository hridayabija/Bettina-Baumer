## Namaḥkāraḥ

Tantra is well known for teaching a state beyond good and evil, virtue and sin, free from any moral judgment. Although this is ultimately true, it can be (and has been) misinterpreted by ignoring the condition for such a realization. Sutra 12 not only gives the condition, but the fact that this topic is coming up at the very end of a number of practices and experiences of overcoming all kinds of dualities in the foregoing sutras shows that the yogi or mystic has to have an evolved consciousness before experiencing the transcendence of good and evil. 

Again significantly, this sutra precedes the final sutra, 13, which contains the peak of the whole teaching, namely the peak of mystical experience. 

The introduction by Anandeśvara Śrīpāda reads as follows:

> "Having described the process of the permanent mode of activity of the *citta* in the previous sutra, now the Yoginī presents the revelation which is free from the distinction between good and evil, based on the light of supreme knowledge beyond any sign."

### Sutra 12

**mahābodhasamāveśāt puṇya pāpa asaṃbandhahaḥ**

"By an absorption in the Great Awakening, there ensues freedom from the association with good and evil." 

**Quotation of the commentary:**

> "The Great Awakening which is experienced by the perfect masters, *mahāgurvi*, means the nature of the highest *gnosis* which is completely free from the stain of distinction of knower, knowledge, known, discursive thought and synthetic thought, and is of the nature of the experience, which is a state of peace beyond peace and of an abode-less abode, because it transcends any temporal order or timelessness. 

> Absorption in this Great Awakening is a radiant manifestation free from any process involving instruments, by entering fully, just as one is and giving up completely, both renouncing and appropriating, by a permanent process of identification with it. Therefore, due to an absorption in the Great Awakening, there follows the freedom from the connection, meaning lack of involvement and non-identification of good and evil, the two forms of *karma* - auspicious and inauspicious - which produce their respective karmic results. 

> The excellent spiritual hero, *vīra*, who while living experiences this freedom without any obstacles will not be reborn. In this very earthly existence, he is ever satiated by enjoying the bliss of this spontaneous experience at all times. He, whoever it may be, is established in this very earthly existence in the Great Liberation, *mahāmukti*, which transcends both bondage and liberation and which is clear just like an *āmalaka* fruit in one's hand. This is the meaning of the sutra." 

Every word describing this highest state of the *vīra* has its power and clarity, and is chosen deliberately. For example, the experience is qualified as *akṛtaka anupava*, as not made, not artificial, without the help of any instruments or *karaṇa*; hence I have translated it as spontaneous. It is also emphasized that the *jīvanmukta* continues to live in the world of becoming having transcended the ultimate duality, that between bondage and liberation. Therefore, their state is called *mahāmukti*, which has no opposite to it.

Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo has again brought this sutra in the field of our experience. His translation reads:

> "By entering in the state of Supreme God Consciousness, one totally surpasses the limitations of good and evil."

And he elaborates:

> "On account of getting entry in Supreme God Consciousness, we feel nothing is right and nothing is wrong. That is the reality. On the other hand, when we are in the ignorance state, again we feel nothing is right and nothing is wrong, but this type of feeling is bound to lead us to degradation. The fact of the matter is, we are established in God Consciousness from the very beginning, from the very source, from the point of start to the end. We will have the insane feeling of nothing is right and nothing is wrong. The Supreme God Consciousness is existing always as such. We are never touched by the *puṇya* by *puṇya* or *pāpa*, good or bad, pure or impure. Only, that is a condition. We have to realize the eternal existence of God Consciousness." 

In conclusion, we can say the yogi has already attained the Supreme Enlightenment in Sutra 12, the perfect soul number 12, an Enlightenment implying the overcoming of all opposites. Is there anything beyond? Sutra 13 will tell us in the next session. 
## Sutra 13

What can be higher than the state of a *jīvanmukta*, a liberated being still living in this body? What can be beyond the Great Liberation, *mahāmukti*? 

The last sutra, 13, of the *Vijñānabhairava*, reads:

**yathā tatra tathānyeṣu  
tathaivātmāvalokane**

"As in that (state of *samādhi*) so in other states of consciousness, so also in the contemplation of oneself."

This is the shortest possible summary of all spiritual teachings, the integration of the highest mystical experience, *samādhi*, in all other states of consciousness. This also means that even self-contemplation, usually understood as a lower practice, is not separate from the highest experience.

This sutra, like the previous one, also needs a commentary for a better understanding. Here is Anandeśvara's commentary:

> “Just as in the state of *samādhi* - the state of complete stillness of the mind - the Supreme Self is experienced as devoid of any distinctions, in the same way, it should be experienced by the wise one in all other states of consciousness, such as waking, dreaming, etc. Similarly, when the yogi contemplates on the Self, the Self is revealed as non-different from the Supreme Self.”

Anandeśvara gives the example of *samādhi* as the experience of the non-dual reality. He suggests that this same experience of non-duality should be the object of contemplation in all other states of consciousness as well. 

This is a radical statement. It is easy to conceive of non-duality in a state of *samādhi*, where the mind is quiet and there are no distractions. But to experience the same non-duality in the midst of daily life, with all its challenges and complexities, is a much taller order.

And yet, this is precisely what the *Vijñānabhairava* is pointing to. The ultimate goal is not to escape from the world but to transform our experience of the world by recognizing its inherent non-dual nature. 

The sutra also mentions "contemplation of oneself" (*ātmavalokana*). This is significant because it suggests that the key to realizing non-duality is not to look outside ourselves for some external deity or principle, but to turn our attention inward and to recognize the divine within. 

In other words, the *Vijñānabhairava* is ultimately a teaching of self-realization. It is through the direct experience of our own true nature that we come to realize our unity with the Divine and with all of creation.

This final sutra is a fitting culmination to the *Vijñānabhairava*'s teachings. It reminds us that the spiritual path is not about escaping from the world but about transforming our experience of the world. And it assures us that the power to achieve this transformation lies within each and every one of us.

Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.
