## The Mysticism of Sound and Language: Unveiling the *Svarā*

Namaste. With Sūtra Seven, we move into the domain of the mysticism of sound and language – *Vāc*,  *Śāstra*, *nāda*. The commentator, Anandaśaktibhāṣya, introduces the Sūtra as follows:

> In this way, having explained the attainment of the fourth state by going beyond the three *guṇas* in the previous Sūtra, now the Yoga is described how in the manifestation of all the forms of speech which are unhindered, the expansion of the power of the primordial sound is always present.

### Sūtra Seven

**vāk caturśṛtayo̎dayavyayau mātrapratyayāḥ śrūśrava pratyayau**

In the experience of the arising and subsiding of the four forms of speech, the original sound of consciousness is revealed.

Before coming to the purport of the Sūtra, the commentator has to give an explanation of the four forms of speech – *vāk*. These forms are stages in the descent of the word from the highest state to the lowest, or of language. They are well known in the *śaiva śāstras* and their commentators and are widely accepted in other systems of Indian philosophy, but here we find a wonderful, concise summary of this important topic.

### Commentary

> In the beginning, the four forms of speech will be described:

1. **Parā:** The supreme word is manifested as containing within herself, in a non-dual way of fusion, all the composition of phonemes – in the simile of the fluid substance contained in a peacock stick which contains all the colors, forms, etc. of the peacock. Her nature is an expansion of the original vibration of consciousness – *prathama-spanda*. It consists in the slight movement or urging in the waveless sky of the absolute.

2. **Paśyantī:** As it arises universally unhindered, the same *Para-vāk*, having attained the nature of the unconstructed, they desire sound – *anahatanāda* – and being undivided, carrying within her the origin of all the phonemes, is like the seed of a banyan tree. Her nature is visionary, and hence she is described as *Paśyantī*.

3. **Madhyamā:** The same *Para-vāk*, having made her own the plane of the intellect, which consists of a number of intents, thought constructs of the nature of determinant conceptions, and who carries within her collection of the collection of phonemes – just like a *śimibīka* fruit contains many seeds – she is called *Madhyamā*, the middle one.

4. **Vaikharī:** The same *vāk* which consists of the sound that strikes the vocal organs – the heart, the throat, the palate – and manifests differentiation like the verse consisting of many letters, is called *Vaikharī*, the corporeal word, who has the capacity of expressing all manifestations of form, etc., attaining a state of expressivity. 

> In this way, four forms of speech which descend from the state of universal consciousness are manifested constantly and without any obstacle. Thus, the arising and subsiding of the four forms of speech, whose nature has been described – these two phases correspond to creation and dissolution; their unfoldment in the manifest and unmanifest states is constantly radiating and flashing forth. This original sound of consciousness – *svarā* – is manifested in the nature of the full expansion of the great resonance – *mahānāda* – which transcends both the unstruck, spontaneous (*anahata*) and the struck sound (*āhata*) in all forms of music and speech. 

Some commentators choose a skilled and interpretive translation, which is very revealing:

> The four forms of speech, in their manifestation of arising and subsiding, reveal the sound where universal I-consciousness is found. 

We understand *svarā* as the expression of I-consciousness. According to this interpretation, the Sūtra points to the practice of awareness of the beginning and end of any utterance, in between the four states of *vāk*. But this requires a very subtle awareness:

> Our consciousness must reside only in a superconscious state in order to take note of the *udaya* and *vyaya* (arising and subsiding) of any state.

> When beginning and end of all these four states appear in our awareness, then *svarā*, the reality of universal consciousness, is revealed. 

When this insight is applied to practice, as can be observed in the case of an unenlightened person, every word uttered, and even every letter or phoneme, is brought down from its transcendent source (*Para-vāk*) up to *Vaikharī*, the spoken word. Therefore, their speech lacks a gravity and depth which is precisely derived from universal I-consciousness. 

But it opens up for us also a practice of greater awareness when using speech – an awareness directed at the beginning and end of any state of *vāk*. It then, indeed, would lead us to the ever higher consciousness.

### The Unity and Multiplicity of Language

The Sūtra throws light on the whole question of the unity and multiplicity of language, already contained in the three beautiful similes for *Para-vāk*, *Paśyantī*, and *Madhyamā*:

1. A peacock's egg.
2. The seed of the banyan tree, in which the whole huge tree is contained in a tiny seed.
3. The fruit containing many seeds inside. 

And the understanding that every phoneme contains all the four levels of *vāk* and is a manifestation of the supreme word!

### A Message for Musicians

This Sūtra and its beautiful commentary can also have a message for musicians, for whom every sound can carry them and their listeners to its transcendent source – *mahānāda*. 
### The Implications of *Vāc* for Understanding Ourselves and the Universe

Delving deeper into the concept of *Vāc* unveils profound implications for understanding ourselves and the universe. 

* **The Power of Speech:**  The Sūtra highlights the immense power residing within speech. It is not merely a tool for communication but a manifestation of consciousness itself. Recognizing this can lead to a more conscious and mindful approach to our words, understanding their potential to create or destroy. 

* **Bridging the Divine and Mundane:** The four levels of *vāk* provide a framework for understanding the descent of divine consciousness into the manifest world. Every utterance, even the seemingly insignificant, carries within it the echo of the primordial sound, connecting us back to the source.

* **Music as a Spiritual Practice:** For musicians, this understanding adds a deeper dimension to their art. By becoming aware of the *svarā* resonating within each note, music becomes a spiritual practice, a path to transcend the limitations of the ordinary and experience the unity of *mahānāda*. 

* **A Call for Inner Listening:** Ultimately, Sūtra Seven invites us to cultivate an inner listening. By paying attention to the arising and subsiding of sounds, both internal and external, we can become attuned to the subtle vibrations of consciousness within and around us. This practice opens a doorway to the mystical dimension of sound and language, revealing the interconnectedness of all things through the universal language of *Vāc*.
