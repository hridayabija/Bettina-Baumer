## Namaḥkārā Sutra 5: The Great Union

Namaḥkārā Sutras three and four have offered us different ways of overcoming dualities, expressed in different metaphors which serve as a basis for meditation. Whether entering the emptiness between two boards or absorbing the macro-microcosmic pair by a process of coincidence of opposites, the fifth sutra represents a positive and enchanting way of unification. The commentator introduces the sutra by establishing the link:

> "Having described the dissolving of the two and their establishment in the supreme reality according to the tradition of teaching about the pair, after that he now reveals the direct experience of the union." 

### Sutra: 

**Siddha-yogini-saṅghattāt mahāmelāpa-udayaḥ**

**By the fusion of *Siddhas* and *Yoginīs* arises the Great Union.**

In tune with the powerful opening concept of the first sutra, *sahasa mahāsāhasa* (the great intensity), this sutra finds expression in two equally powerful words: *saṅghatta* and *melāpa*. The very first benedictory word starts with the word *saṅghatta*, translated there as "unity of friction." These two terms for union contain a sexual imagery, but in the most elevated context of Tantra and Tantric ritual. 

Both commentators, Anandaśakti-pāda and Svāmī Lakṣmaṇa Joo, agree in their interpretation and understand the sutra symbolically or metaphorically. Svāmījī includes interpretation in his translation:

> "By firmly uniting *Siddhas* and *Yoginīs*, that is *aineś* with *diśneś* and *diśneś* with *aineś*, that is *aham* and *idam*, the great union arises," (and extends in the kingdom of *Śakti-cakra*). 

Before going into his interpretation, let us consider the commentary of Anandaśakti-pāda:

> "The *Siddhas* and *Yoginīs* are the sense objects and the divinized senses. Their union as the coming together or the fusion of the object and subject meaning their close embrace and mutual interconnectedness. By this embrace arises the Great Union through the dissolving of the duality of *aineś* and *diśneś* (subjectivity and objectivity). And this is the eternal arising by direct experience (*sākṣātkāra*) of the great fusion of essence (*samarasatā*) in the sky of the unsurpassable absolute consciousness. An arising that is a blissful upsurge. Thus, the absorption in supreme non-duality by the absence of the manifestation of the duality of object and subject is established universally."

The whole language is suffused with expressions of mystical union. The ultimate overcoming of any duality is only found in emerging and embrace, dissolving all difference in oneness. 

Svāmījī has a further interpretation of *mahāmelāpa* (the Great Union):

> "It is a union of God-consciousness with universal consciousness or the unity of the individual soul with the universal soul."

Further:

> "What is that universal unity? Wherever we go we find compact unity (*samarasatā*) of Śiva and Śakti, *aham* and *idam*. The whole universe is held in our consciousness as one with that unity of Śiva and Śakti, God and the Universe. The trance of Śiva and Śakti is found everywhere. This will take place only with the union of *Siddhas* and *Yoginīs*. This *mahāmelāpa*, or Great Union, has wide-reaching implications."

In the words of Svāmījī, as it denotes the unification of Śiva and Śakti:

> "There will be no distinction of master and disciple. There will be no distinction of gender, no distinction of bad and good, or right and wrong. Only the unification of one with another will get rise."

This overcoming of the dichotomy of good and evil will be the subject of one of the last sutras (12) since it is the result of enlightenment.

We have already seen that the *Yoginīs* have inspired Vātula Nātha for composing the sutras. At the end of the *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra*, after teaching 112 ways of attaining supreme consciousness, it is said that the yogi or practitioner who has attained realization even through one of these practices:

> "…he becomes the beloved of the *Yoginīs* and the master of a spiritual gatherings (*melāpaka*)."

Svāmījī comments: 

> "The one who is loved by *Yoginīs*, he becomes one with Lord Shiva."

*Yogini-melāpa* is also ritual union, reunion of Yogis and *Yoginīs* in which initiation takes place. But our sutra, which does not exclude such rituals, is definitely placed at the level of mystical union leading to a universal oneness.
