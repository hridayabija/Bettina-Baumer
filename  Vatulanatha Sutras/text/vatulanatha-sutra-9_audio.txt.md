Namaḥkār. 

I start right with the introduction by Ānandashaktibhādar to sūtra nine. 

> "After describing the tradition of the oral teaching concerning the three essences by way of unbounded universality, now — he means Atulanātha — reveals the direct experience of the teaching concerning the four deities."

## Sūtra Nine

> _Devitaduṣṭayā ullāsenā sadaiva sviśrāntiavasthitiḥ._

When the four deities arise, one gets permanently established in the repose of oneself. This is a very powerful sūtra, because we are not only striving to enlightenment, but to a state which — as the Upaniṣad says — never sets. The sun rises and stays at the zenith and it does not set. So, that state of permanent awakening is what this sūtra, uh, aims at. And like the word "ullāsa," _ullāsa_ has many meanings. It means also splendor, light, and uh, uh, arising. So, it is a dynamic process and a light-filled process. And the goal, which is what we are all aiming at, is a state of resting in one's own being: _sva viśrāntiavasthiti_. 

Now, the commentary by Ānandashaktibhādar:

> "The four deities are called hunger, thirst, envy, and cogitation. Among them, hunger is the great resorption (_mahāsaṃhāra_) because it is always intent on devouring everything. Thirst is resorption (_saṃhāra_) because it dries up everything. Envy brings about the perception of duality and is of the nature of continued existence, sticking, consisting of the assumption of the differentiation in subject and object. Cogitation (_manana_) corresponds to creation (_sṛṣṭi_) in the form of outpouring of synthetic and discursive thought constructs. By the emergence of the four deities in this way — meaning by the experience of the process of the outflow of the voracious consciousness — comes about the establishment of the true nature in the form of the fourfold: upsurge (_udyoga_); manifestation (_abhāsa_); relish (_carvaṇā_); and complete consumption (_alaṅghrasa_) — each one abiding perpetually and at all times. Transcending them in the fifth state, there is establishment in the universal limitless consciousness." 

Ānandashaktībhādar loves to use unconventional words to break the usual language of spiritual processes. These terms taken from ordinary life, like hunger, thirst, etc., evoke a response of surprise, and they do not occur in any other related texts. These terms express the quality of consciousness of absorbing or devouring. They are voracious about duality, multiplicity, and thought constructs. Only in the second part of the commentary, he identifies them with the classical terms of grammar. And there he agrees with Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo's interpretation. 

Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo translates this sūtra as follows:

> "When in each and every act you feel the functioning of four energies, you never get away from your own self-establishment."

He directly relates the four deities to the phases of consciousness, as they are described in the grammar system. These are the spiritual correlations to the universal aspects and to the ordinary states of consciousness: waking, dream, etc. And they are at the highest level identified with divine energies. And the sūtra calls them "devi." 

> _Ullāsenā_. "When these four energies are given rise in the supreme way, both in subjective consciousness and objective consciousness, the establishment in our real nature is certain. _Udyoga_ is the emergence of a fountain of force. _Abhāsa_ is establishment in it. _Carvaṇā_ is enjoying the taste of the nectar of that state. And _alaṅghrasa_ is complete consummation. To sum up: When the whole process is over, the entry in the realm of universal consciousness takes place."

The result of meditation on this sūtra is permanent establishment and repose in the Self in the fifth state, the state of _viśrānti_, in harmony with, as well as transcending, the phases of consciousness and of the universe.
