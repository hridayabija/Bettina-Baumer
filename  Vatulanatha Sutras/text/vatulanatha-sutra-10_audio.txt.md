Namaste. 

Sūtra ten makes it very clear that the mystical experience is not cut off from sense experience. On the contrary, all the senses are transfigured and transmuted into the supreme consciousness, which is compared to the sun and its rays, which are nothing but divine energies. 

Ānandashaktipāda introduces the sūtra in the following way, quote, "Having revealed the system of the oral teaching concerning the four deities in the previous sūtra, now he will explain the secret of the cycle of the twelve _kalās_: *dvādaśākāracakrarahasya*." 

Sūtra ten: *dvādaśārṇavodayanam mahāmārīcivikāsaḥ.* By the rise of the twelve currents, there occurs expansion of the great rays of consciousness.

Commentary. The five cognitive senses beginning with hearing along with the mind, and the five senses of action beginning with speech along with the intellect, are the twelve _kalās_, as they arise collectively. Their radiant manifestation (_ullāsaḥ_) constitutes the current of the all-absorbing consciousness spontaneously, without any cause by their mode of action of supreme freedom, without any constraint in the absolute stillness of the luminous abode. By that flow, there happens an expansion of the great rays of consciousness unobstructed within the flow of each of the senses taking the form of upsurge, manifestation, volition, consumption, and repose. These are the five phases of _karma_ which we have encountered before: *udyoga*, *avabhāsa*, *carvaṇā*, *anugrāsa*, and *viśrānti*. This is the great awakening (*mahāprabodha*), by the dissolution of the perception of all distinctions as such as what is restricted and unrestricted, conscious and inert being of ever-absorbing nature. Being ever-indestructible, it is established everywhere and at all times. This is the meaning of the great saying. End of the quote.

The sūtra is here called *mahāvākya* like the fundamental sentences of the Upaniṣads. Calling this a "great awakening" shows that the process is only complete when there is not only introversion, but also expansion into the cosmic consciousness, which is indestructible. 

Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo has accepted a different reading of the sūtra, *dvādaśārṇavollāsenā* instead of *udayanā* in the Kaśmīr edition. But the meaning does not differ much. His translation reads, quote, "By giving rise to twelvefold flow of energies, the expansion of supreme energy, the preeminence, *svātan*
