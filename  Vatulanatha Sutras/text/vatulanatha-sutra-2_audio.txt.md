## Namaḥ.

The first sūtra was a bold statement about the intensity of the sudden inspiration of the overwhelming state leading to the realization of one's own true nature, *svarūpa*. The second sūtra literally picks up the thread and expands it:

> Tal-lābha̍t yogapat-vṛtti-pravṛttiḥ.

What happens by such an achievement? Attainment of that (_lalābha̍t_), means of the innermost nature and of the great stillness. Here we find the difference in the formulation of the sūtra as transmitted by the commentator and as Swāmi Lakṣmaṇajū has understood it in the clear statement, which I accept.

Let us first listen to the introductory sentence by the commentary:

> "Having explained the oral transmission of the direct experience of the great intensity (_mahāsaṃsāhasa-carcā-sampradāya_), consisting in the sudden attainment of the true nature, which has no characteristic sign and gradually transcends everything."

Now, "they" - already in plural - means the *yoginīs*, or the *pīṭheśvarīs*, the deities of the *pīṭhas*. They reveal the simultaneity of the great fusion, or unification of essence (_samarasya_), of all modes or activities, or states. This is a wonderful sentence explaining what is now coming.

Again, sūtra two:

> Tal-lābha̍t yogapat-vṛtti-pravṛttiḥ.

In my simple translation:

> "By attaining that reckon nature or *mahāsaṃsāhasa*, there is simultane- simultaneously the expansion of all modes or states."

Now, all depends on how we translate *vṛtti* and *pravṛtti*. Swāmījī banaśrī Swāmījī... I mean Swāmi Lakṣmaṇajū. His translation, which I have received from a handwritten manuscript:

> "By that achievement, simultaneously one feels the entry of all senses in their expanded state of universal consciousness."

He takes *vṛtti* as individual consciousness, the activity of the senses; *pravṛtti* as expansion or establishment in universal consciousness. So, his translation immediately places us in the domain of practice and experience. 

An important characteristic of this entire spirituality is **simultaneity**. It is an aspect of overcoming the sequentiality and bondage of time. This could be illustrated by a number of *taranās* of the *Vijñāna Bhairava*, where - either spontaneously, or by meditation - one enters into a state of simultaneously experiencing, for example, that the body and the universe are filled with bliss. Or, another *taranā* is, are filled with consciousness. Such an experience can happen spontaneously without any preparation, or it can be the result of a meditation. And then, there are uh other *taranās*, for example, to merge all the senses in the space of the heart. This is a meditation. It is a meditation, but merging all the senses is also a simultaneous happening. 

Now, Swāmījī gives again another meaning of *vṛtti* and *pravṛtti*. He identifies them with the states of *turīya* and *turīyātīta*. Now, we know in other systems of Indian spirituality there are three or four states of consciousness: *jāgrat*, *svapna*, *suṣupti* (waking, dreaming, deep sleep) and the fourth is the transcendent state, which we experience in *samādhi*. Now, in Kashmir Śaivism, there is a fifth, but we don't call it fifth (it is not a number), but it is that which transcends the fourth, *turīyātīta*. And *turīyātīta* is actually the state of the *jīvanmukta*, because he correlates all four states with the divine consciousness. There's no difference: he can be in activity, or can be sleeping, or dreaming, his state is always in divine consciousness. Now, uh normally we count them - that is why it is called the four uh from waking to dreaming, to deep sleep to the fourth. And then, it would be again a step ahead to the *turīyātīta*. But here, it is simultaneously. So, all these states are simultaneously one with the transcendent state.

And now, consider the interpretation by Abhinavagupta Pada:

> "By attaining one's true nature, which has been described before as consisting of an absorption in the state of great intensity, one simultaneously - meaning at the same time - transcends all the movements of the senses, which are like rays of consciousness, and of emotions like attachment, aversion, etc. By attaining the true nature, which transcends and swallows all conceptions of time and no-time, one is led to a state of the innermost divine nature (*svasvarūpa*)."

There's a gradation between *svarūpa*, which is one's true nature, and *svasvarūpa*, which is the ultimate divine nature. 

> "That is *pravṛtti*, and reaches the state of absorption in it. Thus, this complex statement of the sūtra means that all the activities of the senses and emotions are always and only established in a state of arising by the dissolution of all the mutual differences, and staying in the transcendent aboard of the great emptiness, being one with it."

This expression, "dissolution of all the mutual differences" (*paraspara-vipieḍa-vigalanena*), the Tantric authors, they love this word *vigalana*. They don't like any expression that means suppressing, but just dissolving - just like ice becomes again water. So, *vigalanā* means just merging, dissolving. So, dissolving all these mutual differences of pairs of opposites. End of the quote. 

This last statement is of importance: the overcoming of opposites by merging and establishing them in the great void. When we use the translation "transcending," it sounds very abstract. But, there are two expressions which are very lively. One is *ullanghana*, which we found in the second āh śloka. *Ullanghana* means - the basic meaning - to jump over, to cross over, and even to transgress. Sometimes, it also uh has the meaning to transgress some simple rules of society, etc. The second is a frequent expression in the texts dealing with the overcoming of time: *alaṃgrasa*. *Alaṃgrasa* literally means to swallow, to devour. In the language of Tantra, many spiritual expressions are taken from the context of food, like also *carvaṇā*, chewing, digestive, which also has an application in aesthetic experience, where you experience something beautiful and then you you chew it, you you absorb it. It's a kind of absorbing. 

As far as the overcoming of time is concerned, there is a clear difference between the saying of the *Mahābhārata* that time cooks every all the beings (_kālo pacati_) - in the sense of making them grow, mature, decay, and die - and the Trika and Krama understanding and practice where this precisely the *yogi*, or practitioner, who swallows time, and the result is the experience of simultaneity. Now, by absorbing all the activities and states, and by dissolving all pairs of opposites and dualities, there happens entry in the great void. *Mahāśūnyā* is the same as *śūnyātiśūnyā*, the transcendent void, which as analyzed by Swāmījī, according to the tradition, is at the same time non-void (*mahā-aśūnyā*) hence fullness.
