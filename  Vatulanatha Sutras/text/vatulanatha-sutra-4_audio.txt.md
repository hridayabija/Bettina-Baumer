And this sutra we have seen that enlightenment—by overcoming opposites—can happen by entering the center between the two, which is void. The fourth Sutra brings the theory and practice of overcoming dualities down to its application to all the elements of worldly existence. And in this, it follows the comprehensive scheme of the elements or principles of reality called *tattva*. Which are common to Indian cosmology—twenty-five are common to all systems, and there are thirty-six in Shaivism. The method applied is to absorb the macrocosmic elements with the microcosmic ones, as we shall see. 

First, a brief introduction to the Sutra:

> Now the fruit of liberated isolation (*kaivalya*) will be described, which consists in the absorption of the pairs—I'm not saying which pairs—by merging them in oneness.

And the sutra:

> *yugmagrāsaṁ niravākasasaṁvinniṣṭhā*

> By devouring the pairs of dualities, there is establishment in the universal consciousness. 

Swami Lakshman Joo, in his manuscript, gives a translation which is very close to the basic meaning of the words:

> By sucking inside the twofold realities, establishment in that God consciousness takes place where there is no room for any other agency. —Translation of *niravākaśa*

We have already seen that the language of *Tantra*—and specifically *Kaula*—uses words taken from the domain of food and eating. *Grāsa* is often used to indicate the absorption, devouring, swallowing—thus integrating, and hence eliminating something—such as *kālagrāsa*, meaning devouring (and hence overcoming) of time.

Now, what are these pairs actually? Not of opposites, but of complementarities. They actually comprise not two but three elements in the scheme of *tattvas*: 

1. The cosmic elements (*mahābhūta*): earth, water, fire, wind, and ether. 
2. The five cosmic cognitive senses (*jñānendriya*).
3. And the five motor organs (*karmendriya*). 

The fundamental difference to be overcome is that of classifying things as subject-object, but exemplified with the concrete examples of the *tattvas*. 

So, the commentary begins with a clear statement:

> The arising and separation of the mode of activity of the pair consisting of the great elements, one by one, has the nature of subject and object.

We can see this connection in the case of a few examples. The micro-macrocosmic relationship is demonstrated through the quality traditionally assigned to the cosmic element and its correspondence with human elements. Thus:

> The element earth, due to its predominant quality of smell, is of two kinds in the body: the anals and the sense of smell.

To give another example, the last of the *mahābhūtas*, the element of space or ether (*ākāśa*), which is predominantly experienced through sound, is corresponding to two forms of the senses: the organ of speech and hearing.

Then the commentary gives some alternative ways of finding the subject-object relationship. Even among the cosmic elements, earth and water can be seen as objects, whereas fire and wind can be established as subjects acting on the material elements. *Ākāśa* (space) is divided in manifold ways because it pervades in the body by moving within all the channels (*nāḍī*) due to their pure hollowness. What is important is the insight:

> That the object of experience (*bhokya*) is ever-present in the experiencing subject (*bhoktṛ*) and the subject is ever-present in the object of experience. 

Or else, one can conceive the twofold nature of the—in the sense that every element appears either in manifest or unmanifest form, either as external or internal, either as tranquil or arising, active. And thus this duality of the five elements is swallowed; it's totally absorbed somehow or other and gets established in pure consciousness, where—literally, as translated by Swami Ji—there is no occasion for anything else (*niravākaśa*). 

What is surprising is that overcoming of pairs of opposites even goes so far as to deny the pair *vikalpa-nirvikalpa* (with thought and thought-free), which is the commonest distinction in spiritual discourse. The reason is that it is still a duality. Access to this establishment is neither attained through *vikalpa* nor through *nirvikalpa*. 

> This is very important, transcending of this; still, this duality. Because of the non-dual nature of the immeasurable Absolute, it is called in the sutra "pure consciousness."

How can it be attained in this case? 

> Its establishment is attained by few who receive the vision shown by an excellent Guru. 

Ultimately, the unity attained is summed up with the two traditional terms *kula* and *akula*. 

> Thus this sutra means: by swallowing the duality of *kula* (there is energy) and *akula* (what is derived from it), unity is attained with consciousness which is free from limiting adjuncts, formless and without any phenomenal nature. 

So far we have been close to the commentary by Abhinavagupta. Now we can sum up the implications for our attitude towards the dual nature of reality. Coming back to the term *yugmagrāsa*, the pair—which implies also micro-macro cosmic uh micro-macrocosm—it is actually not of opposites, but of correlations and correspondences, each time related to the subject-object dichotomy. And swallowing means neither destruction, nor exclusion, nor subordination, but integrating the two coincidences of opposites, which is the very dynamic nature of consciousness.

> And I quote: Consciousness in its two interactive aspects, that move in and out from one another, as they become one another. 

So, the result of the meditation on this sutra is the integration of *kula* and *akula*, of the energy and its expansion. But such a realization is not reached by an intellectual understanding alone. It's made clear by the reference to a perfect Guru, who can transmit such a vision of oneness.
