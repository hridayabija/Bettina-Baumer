## The Threefold Rasa and the Emergence of Supreme Brahman

Namaste. 

The preceding sūtras (1-7) have intensified the attainment of the real nature, *svarūpalābha*, in different ways, overcoming duality and interiorization. 

From sūtra 8, the attention shifts towards integrating the inner with the outer, the Self with the universe. Sūtra 8 expresses this through an unusual meaning of *rasa* at three levels, represented by three levels of support (*ādhāra*). These levels correspond to the phases of creation, maintenance, and reabsorption of this world.

The text repeatedly emphasizes that these processes are not driven by will but occur spontaneously through an inner inspirational impulse – the *prathama-pratibhā-ullāsa*. This impulse plays a crucial role in Trika spirituality. This threefold process guides the yogi or mystic to enter the spontaneous *kha-mudrā*. This *mudrā* allows movement within the space of consciousness and is identical to *khecarī-mudrā*, which is based on a state of supreme nonduality.

This state is not occasional but uninterrupted, corresponding to the state beyond the fourth, generally called *turīyatītā*. This state pervades all levels of consciousness. A yogi who attains this stage becomes *jīvanmukta* – enlightened not only for themselves but capable of enlightening the entire world.

Ānandashaktipada, the commentator, introduces sūtra 8 as follows:

> "Having described how by the gradual arising of the four forms of speech, the rise of the unobstructed sound of consciousness shines everywhere and at all times. Now, the supreme unsurpassed abode, experienced in the enjoyment of the three essences, is being explained."

### Sūtra 8:

**rasatrayāsvādanena anityocchalitam vigatabandham paraṃ brahma**

By relishing the three essences, the unbound supreme *brahman* emerges spontaneously.

Ānandashaktipada's commentary continues:

> "Now, some light will be thrown on the three essences, as it has come from the mouth of the guru."

He emphasizes the oral transmission of this knowledge, suggesting its inaccessibility without direct transmission from the guru. 

Relishing the three spontaneous essences experienced in *mūlādhāra*, *payodhāra*, and *ādhāra* allows the emergence of the supreme *brahman*. This *brahman's* nature is the unsurpassed, most excellent consciousness, free from desire, bondage, and the restraints of the dualistic world of *saṃsāra*. It transcends the dual *brahman*, encompassing both tranquility and multiplicity. The supreme *brahman* unfolds perpetually in a state of unceasing existence. 

This process will be explained in its secret or mystical dimension, *rahasyakrameṇa*.

**Mūlādhāra**: It's important to note that *mūlādhāra* here doesn't carry the same meaning as in *Haṭhayoga*, where it represents one of the *chakras* of the subtle body. Here, it retains a literal meaning, unrelated to yoga.

*Mūlādhāra*, the fundamental support, embodies the nature of creation (*sṛṣṭi*). It represents the flashing forth of the first illuminative insight as the great original sound, *ahaṃ-nāda*. This sound becomes the supporting primordial background of consciousness, encompassing both duality and nonduality. 

This background, referred to as *pṛthivi*, literally meaning "plain wall," reflects a philosophical concept. This concept posits consciousness as a plain wall upon which the image of the entire universe is projected.

**Payodhāra**: This term, meaning "support of milk," is used because it nourishes and sustains all things. It embodies the nature of consciousness, which forms the basis for all growth.  

The term *payodhāra* is not commonly found in Tantric or Yogic texts and appears unique to this context. While physically representing the breast, here, it takes on a symbolic meaning of nourishment, like a child receiving sustenance from its mother. This usage of the term is quite unique.

This sustenance relies on the vibration of the original awakening, the *unman-maya*. As it manifests all things, it embodies the nature of maintenance (*sthiti*).

**Ādhāra**: This term, meaning "support" in a general sense, represents withdrawal (*saṃhāra*). This is because it signifies consciousness withdrawing into itself, reabsorbing all things, both sentient and insentient.

The esoteric meaning of the sūtra is as follows: by relishing this triad of essences (*rasatraya*) as a unified fusion of the wonder inherent in each experience, and by reflecting and meditating upon it through entering the uncreated *mudrā* of the sky of consciousness, the nature of the fourth state – known as the great absorption (*mahāsaṃhāra*) – shines uninterruptedly in the state of supreme nonduality.

This *mudrā*, the *kha-mudrā*, is identical to the *khecarī-mudrā*. Abhinavagupta considers *khecarī-mudrā* the highest of all *mudrās* or mystical states. It arises from complete transformation and absorption in that consciousness.

Here, supreme nonduality (*parama-advāda*) also refers to the specific nonduality (*advaita*) of Kashmir Shaivism. This concept is not exclusive but all-inclusive, encompassing even duality (*dvaita*). Every aspect of reality finds inclusion within *parama-advāda*.

The sūtra's essence lies in integrating all levels of experience into the universal consciousness. 

Swami Lakshman Joo offers a different interpretation of the three *rasas*. He identifies them with the three energies: will, knowledge, and activity. He describes three phases of tasting:

> "When we admit the existence of the whole universe, we admit it in our own nature. We do not admit it in the objective field. This is called the first *rasa*," the first moment of tasting. "The second moment of tasting is to give it expansion in the light of that superconsciousness of universality. The third moment of tasting is to grasp intensely that this universe is not separate from the supreme Self. When we taste this universe in this way, then the supreme *brahman*, free of all limitations and bondages, spreads forth."

The sūtra's choice of words – *rasa* and *āsvādana* – highlights that integrating the world into *brahman* is a delightful experience at every stage. Both words carry mystical implications, with *brahman* representing the all-inclusive supreme reality.
