## Namaḥkār.

We have reached the concluding sūtra, which leads us to the peak of the experience of what was contained in the very first sūtra: the great intensity, *mahāsāhasa*, and one's own true nature, *svarūpa*.

### The Concluding Sūtra: Unveiling the Silence

> "After teaching the attainment of one's true essential nature and having explained the process of the tradition of overcoming the duality of good and evil, now the Yoginīs are going to reveal the oral teaching of the silence which is the perfect sound."

**Sūtra 37.  Akathanakatābhilāpā-mahāviṣmayamudrāprāpyā kaśphalatā.**

> "By the power of the unspeakable speech, attaining the mystical attitude, *mudrā*, of great wonder, the luminous resonance of the Void is realised."

The sūtra makes it clear that silence is the ultimate state of the yogin or mystic, who has already realised his or her true nature, *svarūpa*, and who has, at the end of the process and experiences contained in the 12 sūtras, already overcome all dualities, including that between good and evil—a duality that, by the way, on which most religions are based. But that silence is not empty. It is full of wonder and surprise. And it is the silence which, at the same time, contains and transcends language at its ultimate stage. It is a culmination of all languages.

Following our method, I will still give an at least partial translation of Abhinavagupta's commentary. He interprets the negative 'a' in *akathana* literally, and he goes into the whole theory of language or speech.

### Abhinavagupta's Commentary: Delving into the Unspeakable

> "Here we will reflect a little *mārk* on the power of the unspeakable speech, following the tradition transmitted orally from the mouth of the guru. A speech means of the letter 'a' which arises in four forms, that is, struck or produced sound, *āhata*, unstruck sound, *anāhata*, unstruck and struck sound, *anāhata-āhata-āhata*, and beyond unstruck and struck. Its telling, *kathana*, is unspeakable, according to the agreement of the oral teaching."

Then follows a summary of the four manifestations of sound:

1. **Āhata (Struck Sound):**  The sound produced by striking implies the speech uttered by the vocal organs and the four phonemes of language from *a* to *ha*, which manifests a variety of objects.
2. **Anāhata (Unstruck Sound):** This refers to the supreme resonance, *parā-nāda*, which flashes forth from the root without any sound and which is indicated by its expansion in the material sound of a string instrument.
3. **Anāhata-āhata-āhata (Struck from Unstruck Sound):** This is connected with both struck and unstruck sound. It is unstruck because there is the experience of repose in the cavity of the ear, and it is also struck, as the sound which is perceived in the space in the middle of the two ears. 
4. **Beyond Struck and Unstruck:** This sound is the resonance which is thought-free, flashing forth from the great abode, free from obstacles, and it is of the nature of the great vibration in the form of the primal 'a' sound. This resonance is free from contraction and expansion, being of the nature of the supreme expansion. This experience is the great mantra of I-consciousness, which cannot be uttered and is beyond touch."

Now there follows a connection with the four goddesses Vāmā, Jālamdhārī, Ambikā and Cistā, which we omit. Then he comes to the word 'power', *balena*.

> "Its power is the vitality, *vīrya*, which takes the form of manifesting in the ways of struck, unstruck, struck from unstruck and transcending them. Hence, 'by the power of the unspeakable speech' of the sūtra. That revelation, *kathana*, being a speech beyond the multiplicity of language is the power of the oral teaching concerning the letter 'a', which is unutterable. This revelation is an awareness of the essential nature free from any sign. It is realised by the process of transmission. This verily is the power which is the essence of the uncreated expansion."

### The Transmission of Power: Dissolving Subjectivity

> "Now we will expand briefly on this transmission of the power. The excellent teacher who is established in the luminous abode of wave-less consciousness by dissolving the subjectivity based on vital energy, *prāṇa*, the subtle body, *prāṇasthaka*, and the Void by the visionary power of the stillness of bliss and the beauty of the supreme Voidness, he does not depend on the three factors: object, the senses, and action. Whatever he envisions has the perception of the nature of the universal vibration of consciousness, that becomes forever transformed into oneness with consciousness. There is no doubt about it."

### Beyond Worship: The Constant Expansion of Consciousness

> "And now he tells another way of interpretation. Revelation, *kathana*, is manifested in the collection of the six *Darśanas*, the four Tantric traditions, the process of the union of Śivas and Yoginīs by taking support of the cycle of deities in the order of worship with or without rules and injunctions. Here again, however, according to the vision of the tradition of excellent Śivas like the venerable Naṭṭanātha, by giving up the relationship of worship, worshiper and the object of worship, there is nothing but the constant expansion of the perfect great rays of consciousness, which is not different from the essential nature, which is all-transcending and which reigns supreme everywhere and at all times. This is the power of the unspeakable speech by which the state of great wonder is attained. This is the connection in the sūtra."

### The Great Wonder: Entry into One's True Nature

> "Now the great wonder, *mahāviṣmaya*, is the entry in one's own true essential nature by giving up and destroying the conceit implied with the words 'viṣmaya' and 'smaya'. The conceit, which is a reflection of both limited and unlimited ego. By transcending all this, there occurs entry in one's own true nature. And this great wonder is a sudden absorption in the mode of moving in the sky of consciousness, which is ever unbound by giving up, literally forgetting, the difference between self and other. This is very important. This is verily the *mudrā*, the mystical attitude, which contains all the *mudrās*. It is a complete absorption in the state of silence."

### Kaśphalatā: The Luminous Resonance of the Void

> "This being the case, there ensures the luminous resonance of the sky of consciousness, *kaśphalatā* of the sūtra. The meaning of *kaśphalatā* is the harmonious unity, *saṃraśya*, of the revelation of the thirteen oral teachings. The luminous resonance of the sky of consciousness, *kaśphala*, is the attainment which bestows by itself the Void of being. It means it pervades and makes one's own the sky of consciousness. This is the meaning of *kaśphala*, resonance of the Void."

### Avadhūta's Oral Tradition: A Summary by Abhinavagupta

> "A certain *kaula* ascetic Avadhūta, that is, Vātula-nātha, has revealed the oral tradition of the time of the great union with the goddesses of the sacred seats, *pīṭheśvarī*, composed in the form of sūtras by attaining direct experience of non-duality of the plane of the *Anuttarā* in the oral teaching of the thirteen sūtras which contain the essence of the six *Darśanas*, the four Tantric traditions and all the unions of Śiva and Yoginī. On this, I have composed a brief commentary in order to awaken the good and the wise."

This is the motivation that Abhinavagupta gives. The purpose of the commentary is to awaken the good (*satsa-nt*) and the wise. Then he concludes with a verse, *saṅkalpaśloka*.

### Abhinavagupta's Concluding Verse

> "Somebody, that is, Vātūlanātha, has perfectly and expressly revealed the supreme secret which is free from the mass of discursive thoughts of language, being liberated from the error which separates worldly and divine reality, incomparable, by an expansion of consciousness in a mode which is manifestation of the supreme reality of the great intensity or suddenness, *sāhasa*, which is artless and uncreated." 

### Svāmī Lakṣmaṇjoo's Interpretation: A Different Perspective

The interpretation of this final sūtra differs substantially between Abhinavagupta and Svāmī Lakṣmaṇjoo. Svāmījī's interpretation is clear and straightforward. 

> "By maintaining the power of speechless state of speech, *parā*, one attains the *mudrā* of astonishment. Hence entry in the kingdom of voidness flows forth." 

He takes the negative prefix in '*akathana*' only in the sense of 'speechless', not related to the letter 'a' as does Abhinavagupta. And he gives more importance to the mystical expression '*mahāviṣmayamudrā*', which is the key for understanding this concluding sūtra. 

Svāmījī relates *akathanakatābhilāpanā*, the power of speechless speech, to *parā*, the supreme level of the Word, *parā-vāk*. Thus, *akathanakatābhilāpanā* means—

> "Thus, *akathanakatābhilāpanā* means 'by maintaining the power of speechless state of speech, *parā*, one attains the *mudrā* of the state of astonishment'."

In descending order after *parā* follows *paśyantī*, the visionary, where there is no speech, but a subtle tendency—

> "towards the outward flow in the world of speech, that is, in the world of objectivity."

The next stage is *madhyamā*, the intermediate state of speech, at the level of thought. The lowest in this descent is *vaikharī*, the absolutely gross form, in Svāmījī's words. The main difference between *madhyamā* and *vaikharī* is that *madhyamā* is internal gross speech and *vaikharī* is external gross speech. 

He connects *mahāviṣmayamudrā* with the Śiva-sūtra, 'viṣmayo yogabhūmikāḥ', the highest states of yoga are full of wonder. Now he explains the content of this wonder and surprise:

> "Viṣmayamudrā means the stamp imprinted—" This is the meaning of *mudrā*, also, 'stamp' and 'imprint'. 

> "The stamp imprinted on me is *viṣmaya*..."
