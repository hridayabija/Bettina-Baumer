If sudden enlightenment is possible, and is the purpose of the revelation of these certain sūtras, what is the obstacle preventing us? It is our dualistic way of perception and living with all kinds of dichotomies. The previous sūtras were aiming at overcoming any duality by different approaches and methods. But it is not only duality, like subject-object etc., which is to be overcome, but the three phases or aspects of consciousness which are obscuring and have to be transcended in order to enter the fourth state of pure consciousness: *turīya*. 

The commentary of Ānandashaktipāda gives the following introduction to sūtra six, connecting it with the previous one: 

> Having taught the arising of the great union by dissolving the duality, the Yoginī hints at the attainment of the unsurpassed most elevated state which is reached by overcoming the three limiting coverings.

## Sūtra six:

**trikaṁśukaparatyāgān nirādhyapadamasthitiḥ**

By completely giving up the three limited coverings, establishment in the inexpressible state is attained. 

Ānandashaktipāda provides several interpretations of the three *kaṁśukas* or obscuring coverings. They are classified as follows: 

> The three coverings are differentiated as *prāviṇaka*, *bhautika* and *śūnya*. 

And these terms will be explained in different ways according to different philosophies: 

> *Prāviṇaka* means here the subtle elements (*tanmātra*) beginning with sound and ending with the ego (*ahaṅkāra*). *Bhautika* is in the form of earth and other gross elements. *Śūnya* or void is the victor of motionlessness or dissolving, or else of latent impressions (*vāsanā*).

To mention it in this context, *śūnya* is not the great or absolute voidness which we have encountered before, but the limited and limiting void. 

Or according to Nyāya, *prāviṇaka* means an external object like a jar. *Bhautika* is internal and has the nature of the senses and sense perception. *Śūnya*, the void, is the space between the two. 

Or else in the context of states of consciousness as in Vedānta, *prāviṇaka* is called the dream state and creation (*sṛṣṭi*). *Bhautika* is the waking state, said to be maintenance (*sthiti*), and *śūnya*, the void, is the state of deep sleep which is called dissolution (*saṁhāra*).

Being established in this way by giving up the three coverings -- meaning renunciation -- comes about the establishment in the inexpressible state. It means a state where expression fails and which cannot be described. This is the supreme abode beyond words, the indescribable absolute. And this is an abiding in the supreme space without any characteristic marks which transcends all things. This is the permanent establishment in one's own true nature which is never lost. This is the connection of the words in the sūtra and of the quote of the commentary.

Śrī Lakṣmaṇjoo translates the sūtra in the following way:

> By throwing away the threefold coverings, the inexpressible state of transcendental consciousness is received. 

He gives another meaning of the three coverings which completely hide the real nature of oneself: They are the knower, knowledge, and the known; or subject, object, and cognition. Thus it is not only a matter of overcoming the duality of subject-object, but of the three constituents of knowledge which determine all our knowing and acting. 

He further explicates that: 

> "...the covering of knower covers the unconscious, subconscious, and conscious state of our being. These correspond again to the conscious state of waking (*jāgrat*), subconscious state of dreaming (*svapna*) and the unconscious state of deep sleep."

Again, it is only when we leave behind this threefold coverings that we achieve the inexpressible state of being (*nirādhya*):

> "Establishment in the state of being will take place only when we keep away from all these threefold coverings."

Any one of these interpretations leads to the attainment of the fourth transcendental state, *turīya*. *Nirāga nirādhya* is actually a state of mystical awareness which becomes permanent only after our ordinary states of waking, dream and sleeping are overcome. However, this fourth state of consciousness is also present in all of them.
