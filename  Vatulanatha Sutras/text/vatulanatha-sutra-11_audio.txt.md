## Namaḥ.

Sūtra 11 has to be approached from the perspective of a *siddha* or *jīvanmukta* and in the light of his or her integral experience and mode of activity. The meaning hangs on the translation of *caryā* which, in the context of the *āgamas*, denotes the practices and conduct of an initiate, but here it is not related to any rules of behavior but to a state transcending them. The number five is all-inclusive but specifically related to the sense organs and the absorption of their respective sensations into consciousness.

The introduction by Abhinavaguptapāda's editors follows:

> After having revealed the unobstructive permanent absorption, which is realized without any cause, in the perspective of the rise of the twelve currents, now the Yoginī's will explain the oral tradition of the five modes of activity, *caryā*.

### Sūtra 11

**Caryāpañcakodaye niṣṭaraṅgasamāveśaḥ.** "By the emergence of five modes of activity, a state of waveless absorption is attained."

**Commentary:** The five modes of activity are of the nature of *anāśritā* (without support), *avadhūtā* (having thrown off all restrictions), *unmattā* (mad, insane), *sarvabhakṣyā* (all-consuming), and the great omnipervasive one, *mahāvyāpakā*. Their emergence is a joyful upsurge of the needs of expansion, which rises from within the collective energies with or without restraint. When this happens, nothing but the truth of unsurpassed absorption is experienced, which is characterized as a complete pervasiveness, devoid of the fluctuations which arise in the case of the individual way, the way of energy, and the divine way. 

**Abhinavaguptapāda**, **Śāmbhava**. 

Now this is surprising that even *Śāmbhava* is excluded from this state because there is a fluctuation. Any *upāya* has a movement. Even *Śāmbhava*, only *anupāya* is still. 

Come back. Now I will explain in due order the five modes of activity emitted: 

*   **Anāśritā**: In that context, the supportless mode, which is due to a state devoid of foundation, arises in order to withdraw the objects of its own perception into consciousness. By making sounds enter into the cavity of the ear, it is of the nature of supreme space. 
*   **Avadhūtā**: The mode of having shaken off all conditionings is manifested by an unrestricted state on the part of the power of vision, moving everywhere in order to withdraw its own objects into consciousness. 
*   **Unmattā**: The mode of madness related to the organ of smell distinct, is manifested freely like the behavior of a mindless lunatic, who does not discriminate the relationship between what is acceptable, what is not acceptable, in order to absorb its respective objects into consciousness. 
*   **Sarvabhakṣyā**: The all-consuming mode related to the sense of taste has a tendency of swallowing all the residual traces, *saṃskāra*, which are to be consumed. It arises in order to devour its own objects, which are to be absorbed in consciousness. 
*   And **sarvavyāpikā**: The all-pervasive mode is manifested by the activity of the sense of touch, due to its omnipervasiveness, in order to appropriate all the sensations of touch in consciousness. 

This is the emergence of the five modes of supreme activity, *caryāpañcakā*.

**End of the quote of Abhinavaguptapāda.**

The interpretation by Swami Lakṣmaṇjoo differs from Ananavaguptapāda's, but it is too brief in what has come down to us because this is a transcript from an oral teaching to be directly related to the *sūtra*. However, as always, Swamiji provides the key for understanding the whole process. He distinguishes *caryā* from *karma*, action of the limited, individual way. He defines it in the present context which is in agreement with Abhinavaguptapāda.

> "When we enter through all the senses in God consciousness, then that act is called *caryā*."

One version of his translation reads:

> "When observance of the five great acts gets established in the realized being, the supreme state where there is no agitation at all is entered into." 

And he describes the five acts as follows:

1.  Silence.
2.  Agitating movement.
3.  Agitated state.
4.  Confirmation.
5.  And supreme silence, known also as *nirājanākhyā*.

The main difference between the two interpretations is that Swamiji takes the five modes of *caryā* in the sense of stages of ascent. 

> "We have to start from objectivity in a silenced mind. Then, agitating movement comes in our view in silence. And that too we have got to be aware. That awareness will lead us into the kingdom of God consciousness. Confirmation of the agitated state is in no way other than the supreme splendor."

Now we understand what he means by agitation, not the ordinary *kṣobha*. We also say it's not *kṣobha*, but it is *spanda*. So, because we know that consciousness in this tradition is dynamic. So, it is not a totally static, but there is *spanda*. There is a, uh, dynamism of consciousness, the supreme vibrative movement. And that supreme behavior, there's no agitation at all. 

In conclusion, I would come back to the five ways of *caryā*, as given by Abhinavaguptapāda, in his characteristically original terminology. These five, which are states of ecstasy related to the divinized senses which absorb and transform their objects into pure consciousness, they show the great freedom of the liberated being, a freedom which finds expression in a variety of ways which reach their ultimate repose in a complete absorption *niṣṭaraṅgasamāveśaḥ*.
