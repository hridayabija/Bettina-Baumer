##Unveiling the Eternal Repose: A Deep Dive into Sūtra Nine ofthe Trika System

This exploration embarks on a journey into the profound depthsof sūtra nine within the Trika system of Kashmiri Shaivism, meticulously unraveling its layers of meaning through the insightful commentaries of Ānandashaktibhādar and Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo. This sūtra illuminates the path to "permanent awakening," a state of perpetual Self-realizationakin to the sun radiating its brilliance eternally at its zenith.

### The Gateway to Unsetting Awareness: Sūtra Nine and its Essence

At the heart of this exploration lies the ninth sūtra itself, a beacon guiding us towards therealization of our true nature:

> **_Devitaduṣṭayā ullāsenā sadaiva sviśrāntiavasthitiḥ._**

This compact yet potent statement, when translated, reveals the essenceof the sūtra: "When the four deities arise, one gets permanently established in the repose of oneself."

Each word in this sūtra is pregnant with meaning:

* **_Devitaduṣṭayā_**: This compound word sets the stage, introducing the "four deities" ( *devita* ), a term pregnant with symbolic significance, and their "arising" or "emergence" ( *duṣṭayā*). 
* **_Ullāsenā_**: This term is crucial, signifying not merely the "arising" of these deities but hinting at the transformative nature oftheir emergence. _Ullāsa_ carries connotations of "splendor," "light," and "dynamic process" – implying that this is not a passive awakening but a vibrant, transformative unfolding.
* **_Sadaiva_**: This Sanskrit term emphasizes the permanence of this state of being – "always," "eternally," without end or interruption.
* **_Sviśrāntiavasthitiḥ_**: This compound word unveils the ultimate goal: *Sva* (one's own), *viśrānti* (repose, rest, peace), *avasthiti* (establishment, abiding) – signifying a state of unshakeable and continuous abiding in the peace of one's true Self.

The sūtra, therefore, encapsulates the essence of the journey: Through the dynamic emergence and understanding of the "four deities," an individual transcends the limitations of ordinary consciousness, attaininga state of perpetual Self-awareness and liberation. This "repose" (*viśrānti*) is not mere relaxation or a temporary reprieve from the world's turmoil but a profound state of being established in the unchanging reality of one's true Self. 

### Delving into the UnconventionalSymbolism: Ānandashaktibhādar's Interpretation

Renowned for his unconventional approach to spiritual teachings, Ānandashaktibhādar decodes the symbolism of the "four deities," presenting them as personified aspects of human consciousness rather than literal divine beings:

* **Hunger (_bubhukṣā_): The Great Resorption (_mahāsaṃhāra_)**

 Hunger, an intrinsic drive in all living beings, becomes a potent metaphor for the expansive nature of consciousness. It represents the inherent urge to experience, to consume, to merge with all that is perceived as "other." This insatiablehunger is likened to _mahāsaṃhāra_, the "great resorption" – the process by which the universe eventually dissolves back into its source. Just as hunger seeks to satiate itself by consuming food, so too does consciousness seek to dissolve all boundaries, ultimately merging back into the unity of pure awareness.

* **Thirst (_tṛṣṇā_): The Resorption (_saṃhāra_)**

 Thirst, the craving for sustenance and fulfillment, becomes a representation of consciousness's absorptive quality. Just as thirst seeks to quench itself by assimilating liquids, consciousness seeks todissolve all duality into the singularity of its own being. This process is equated to *saṃhāra*, the "resorption" that occurs on a cosmic level when differentiated forms dissolve back into their undifferentiated source. Thirst, in this context, symbolizes the yearning for unity, the desire to transcend theillusory boundaries that separate the individual from the universal.

* **Envy (_īrṣyā_): The Perpetuation of Duality (_dvaitāpanna_)**

 Envy, often seen as a negative emotion, takes on a profound meaning in this context. It embodies the tendency ofthe mind to create separation and differentiation. Envy arises from perceiving "lack" within oneself and "completeness" in another, thereby reinforcing the illusory divide between "self" and "other." This continuous process of comparison and judgment, of feeling incomplete and separate, is what Ānandashaktibhādar refers toas *dvaitāpanna_ – the state of being caught in the illusion of duality. 

* **Cogitation (_manana_): The Creative Outpouring (_sṛṣṭi_)**

 Cogitation, the ceaseless activity of the mind, embodies the creative force of consciousness. Just asthe universe arises from an unmanifested potential, our thoughts and mental constructs emerge from the fertile ground of pure awareness. This constant outpouring of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and perceptions is likened to *sṛṣṭi*, the act of creation. However, Ānandashaktibhādar cautions usthat this creative process, while essential, can also lead to further entanglement in the web of illusion if we mistake these mental constructs for ultimate reality.

#### The Four Stages of Unveiling: From Upsurge to Complete Consumption

Ānandashaktibhādar further elucidates that the emergence of these "deities"isn't random but signifies a progression through four distinct stages of spiritual unfolding:

1. **Upsurge (_udyoga_): The Spark of Awakening**

 _Udyoga_ marks the initial stirring of awareness, the dawning recognition of our true nature beyond the limitations of the ego-self. Like a seed awakening within the earth, this stage is characterized by a yearning for liberation, a longing for something beyond the confines of the conditioned mind.

2. **Manifestation (_abhāsa_): Perceiving the True Self**

 _Abhāsa_ signifies the blossoming of this inner yearning intoa clear perception of one's true nature. The veil of illusion begins to lift, revealing glimpses of the radiant Self, distinct from the fluctuating emotions, thoughts, and perceptions of the mind. It's a stage of increasing clarity, where the seeker begins to differentiate between the transient and the eternal.

3.**Relish (_carvaṇā_): Savoring the Nectar of Self-Knowledge**

 _Carvaṇā_ represents the blissful experience of abiding in this newfound awareness. Having tasted the sweetness of Self-knowledge, the seeker revels in the peace, joy, and freedom that accompany thisstate of being. It's a stage of deep contentment, of effortlessly resting in the fullness of the present moment.

4. **Complete Consumption (_alaṅghrasa_): Dissolving into Unity**

 _Alaṅghrasa_ symbolizes the final dissolution of all limitations, the complete integration with theultimate reality. Having traversed the inner landscape and shed the layers of conditioning, the individual consciousness merges back into its source, just as a drop of water reunites with the vastness of the ocean.

#### Transcendence and Realization: The Fifth State

By moving through these four stages, guided by awareness andgrace, one transcends the limitations of the "four deities" and attains the fifth state: establishment in "universal limitless consciousness." This state, the ultimate goal of the Trika system, is not a void but a dynamic and vibrant experience of unity, where the individual realizes their inseparable connection to the infinite tapestry ofexistence.

### Aligning with Universal Consciousness: Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo's Perspective

Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo, renowned for his clarity and precision, offers a different yet complementary interpretation of the ninth sūtra, translating it as:

> "When in each and every actyou feel the functioning of four energies, you never get away from your own self-establishment."

Instead of personifying them as "deities," Lakṣmaṇjoo links the "four energies" directly to the four fundamental states of consciousness described in Sanskrit grammatical tradition, highlighting their universal applicability:

1. **_Udyoga_ (Emergence): The Waking State (_jāgrat_)**

 _Udyoga*, in this context, corresponds to the waking state, our everyday experience of the external world. It's the state of outward awareness, characterized by activity, engagement with sensory perceptions, and interactionswith the external environment. Lakṣmaṇjoo emphasizes that even within this seemingly mundane state lies the potential for Self-realization.

2. **_Abhāsa_ (Manifestation): The Dreaming State (_svapna_)**

 _Abhāsa_ aligns with the dreaming state, where themind, freed from the constraints of external sensory input, creates its own internal reality. This state, characterized by vivid imagery, emotions, and often illogical narratives, highlights the mind's creative power and its ability to generate experiences independent of external stimuli. 

3. **_Carvaṇā_ (Relish): The Deep Sleep State (_suṣupti_)**

 _Carvaṇā_, according to Lakṣmaṇjoo, parallels the state of deep, dreamless sleep. In this state, the mind's activity subsides, the incessant chatter of thoughts quiets down, and a sense of blissfulunity pervades. Although seemingly unconscious, this state points to the underlying ground of pure awareness that exists beyond the fluctuations of the mind. 

4. **_Alaṅghrasa_ (Complete Consummation): The Fourth State (_turīya_)**

 _Alaṅghrasa_ represents the culminationof the spiritual journey, the realization of *turīya*. This "fourth state" transcends the limitations of the previous three, residing beyond the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states. It's a state of pure awareness, devoid of any content, yet pulsating with the vibrancy of pure being.#### Divine Energies: Recognizing the Sacred in the Mundane

Lakṣmaṇjoo emphasizes that these states of consciousness are not merely psychological phenomena but represent "divine energies" operating within and through us. By becoming increasingly aware of their interplay in our thoughts, actions, and experiences – from the mundane to the profound –we progressively disentangle our sense of self from its identification with these fleeting states, gradually becoming established in the unchanging reality of our true Self. 

### The Unifying Thread: Achieving Permanent Repose

Both Ānandashaktibhādar and Swāmi Lakṣmaṇjoo, despite their different approaches,converge on a crucial point: the path to liberation hinges upon understanding and transcending the various aspects of our being – whether symbolized as "deities," "phases of consciousness," or "divine energies."

Through dedicated spiritual practices like meditation, self-reflection, and mindful living, we cultivate the capacity to witness these aspectswithout attachment, recognizing them as transient fluctuations rather than defining characteristics of our true Self. We become aware of the "voracious" tendencies of the mind – the hunger for experience, the thirst for fulfillment, the envy that creates separation, and the incessant cogitation that weaves intricate webs of thought – and gently release theirhold on our sense of identity.

As we progress through the four stages of spiritual unfolding – upsurge, manifestation, relish, and complete consumption – we gradually shed the layers of conditioning that obscure the radiant light of our true nature. Finally, we come to rest in the fifth state, the state of permanent repose (_viśrānti_), where the "sun" of our awareness shines eternally, illuminating the entirety of our being. 

This state, as beautifully articulated by both commentators, is not a static or lifeless void but a dynamic and vibrant experience of "universal limitless consciousness." We exist in harmony with, yet transcend, the fluctuating nature of the mind and the universe, realizing our interconnectedness with all of creation while simultaneously resting in the unperturbed peace of our true Self. This is the ultimate liberation promised by the ninth sūtra: a state of perpetual awakening, where the flame of awareness burns bright, illuminating the eternal truth ofour being.
