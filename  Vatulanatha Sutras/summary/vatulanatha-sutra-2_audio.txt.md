##Namaḥ

The second sūtra of this text takes us further down the rabbithole of *svarūpa*, building on the profound foundation laid by thefirst. We are invited to explore the landscape of this realization, not as a linear progression, but as a simultaneous unfolding of awareness.

### Unveilingthe Sūtra: The Whisper of the Yoginīs

The second sūtra itself is a compact and powerful statement:

> **Tal-lābha̍t yogapat-vṛtti-pravṛttiḥ.**

These words are not merely pronouncements of human origin, but rather whispers from the *yoginīs* or *pīṭheśvarīs*, the verydeities who preside over the sacred *pīṭhas*, centers of spiritual energy. They speak of a truth accessible through direct experience, a truth revealed when one pierces the veil of ordinary perception.

The sūtra, at its core, describes a profound shift in experience upon reaching *svarūpa*, the realization of one's true nature. This shift is not a gradual process but a sudden and all-encompassing merging of all dualities – a grand symphony of existence playing out within the awakened consciousness. This unification is known as *samarasya*, a Sanskrit term that beautifully captures the harmonious blending of all aspects of being.

Imagine a drop of water merging into the vast ocean. It doesn't simply disappear; rather, it becomes one with the immensity, its essence expanding to encompass the whole. This is the essence of *samarasya*, a state where the individual's limited experience dissolves into the boundless ocean of pure consciousness.

### Interpreting the Sūtra: Beyond the Literal Veil

Translating the sūtra directly offers us a glimpse into its meaning:

> "By attaining that (referring to *svarūpa*or *mahāsaṃsāhasa*), there is simultaneously the expansion of all modes or states."

However, to truly grasp the profundity of this statement, we must move beyond a mere literal interpretation. The Sanskrit terms *vṛtti* and *pravṛtti* hold the key to unlocking deeper layersof meaning.

#### Swāmi Lakṣmaṇajū's Illumination

**Swāmi Lakṣmaṇajū**, a revered master of this lineage, provides an invaluable interpretation, guiding us towards an experiential understanding:

> "By that achievement, simultaneously one feels the entry of all senses intheir expanded state of universal consciousness."

Here, *vṛtti* is presented as the functioning of individual consciousness, particularly through the lens of the five senses. It represents our limited and fragmented perception of reality, bound by the filters of our individual minds and bodies. 

*Pravṛtti*, incontrast, signifies the expansion of this limited awareness into the vastness of universal consciousness. It is the merging of the drop into the ocean, where the individual's sensory experience is no longer bound by the confines of the personal self.

Lakṣmaṇajū's interpretation highlights the transformative impact of *svarūpa* on our perception. It is not just an intellectual understanding but a visceral experience, where the senses themselves become instruments of perceiving the interconnectedness of all things. This interconnectedness is not merely conceptual, but a lived reality, pulsating through every fiber of one's being.

### Simultaneity: Time Bends to the Awakened Heart

The concept of **simultaneity** forms the very fabric of this spiritual path. It challenges our ordinary perception of time as a linear progression from past to present to future, revealing instead the illusory nature of this construct. 

The awakened consciousness transcends the limitations of time, experiencing multiple states of being as co-existing and interconnected. Past, present, and future merge into a singular, timeless now.

This radical shift in perception is not a distant possibility but an attainable reality, as evidenced by the numerous *taranās* outlined in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. This sacred text, revered within Tantric traditions, offers practical techniques for accessing these expanded states of awareness.

#### *Taranās*: Glimpses of the Timeless

The *Vijñāna Bhairava* presents a diverse array of *taranās*, each serving as a unique portal to experiencing thesimultaneity of existence. 

One *taranā* might guide the practitioner to perceive the universe and their own body as simultaneously filled with bliss, dissolving the perceived boundary between self and other. This blissful state is not merely a fleeting emotion, but a fundamental quality of existence, accessible when the veil of separationis lifted.

Another *taranā* might focus on the merging of all senses within the heart space. This practice goes beyond a purely physical understanding of the heart, drawing upon its symbolic significance as the seat of consciousness. By consciously directing the senses inwards, the practitioner dissolves their fragmented perception, experiencing theworld as a unified sensory symphony emanating from within.

These are just two examples within a vast tapestry of *taranās*, each offering a different flavor of this timeless reality. Some might occur spontaneously, erupting into awareness like unexpected bursts of insight. Others might require dedicated meditative practice, a patient and persistent chippingaway at the limitations of ordinary perception. Yet, the destination remains the same: a direct experience of the simultaneous and interconnected nature of all things.

### Delving Deeper: *Turīya* and *Turīyātīta*

Swāmi Lakṣmaṇajū, in hischaracteristic depth, draws a parallel between *vṛtti* and *pravṛtti* and the states of *turīya* and *turīyātīta*. This connection bridges the gap between seemingly abstract concepts and tangible states of experience.

#### The Four and the Beyond: A Map of ConsciousnessTraditional Indian spiritual systems often depict four primary states of consciousness:

1. **Jāgrat:** The waking state, characterized by outward focus and engagement with the external world through the five senses. 
2. **Svapna:** The dreaming state, where internal processes take center stage, and the mind weavesintricate tapestries of images, emotions, and sensations.
3. **Suṣupti:** Deep sleep, a state of withdrawal from both external and internal stimuli, marked by a sense of unconscious unity.
4. **Turīya:** This fourth state, often translated as "transcendent," liesbeyond the realm of ordinary waking, dreaming, and sleeping. It is the experience of pure consciousness, devoid of content, the silent ground upon which all other states arise.

Kashmir Śaivism, however, introduces a fifth state: *turīyātīta*. This is not merely an addition tothe existing framework, but a radical departure. *Turīyātīta* transcends even the transcendent, defying categorization and exceeding the limitations of language. It is the state of the *jīvanmukta*, a liberated being who moves through the world without separation, perceiving the divine in all things.

####Not a Stairway, But a Tapestry

It is crucial to understand that these states are not separate compartments, but interwoven threads within the tapestry of consciousness. *Turīyātīta* does not negate or diminish the other states but rather infuses them with its boundless awareness.

For the *jīvanmukta*, waking, dreaming, and deep sleep are all experienced as expressions of the Divine. There is no seeking to escape one state or attain another, but rather a profound acceptance and integration of all that arises within the field of awareness. This is the essence of simultaneity: the recognition thatall states, all experiences, are ultimately facets of the same luminous reality.

### Abhinavagupta's Perspective: Dissolving the Dualistic Illusion

**Abhinavagupta**, a luminary of Kashmir Śaivism, adds another layer of insight to our understanding:

> "By attainingone's true nature, which has been described before as consisting of an absorption in the state of great intensity, one simultaneously - meaning at the same time - transcends all the movements of the senses, which are like rays of consciousness, and of emotions like attachment, aversion, etc. By attaining the true nature, whichtranscends and swallows all conceptions of time and no-time, one is led to a state of the innermost divine nature (*svasvarūpa*)."

Abhinavagupta emphasizes that this attainment is not a passive process. It requires a complete immersion (*absorption is his word*) in the intensity of one's own being. This is not intensity in the conventional sense, as in excitement or agitation, but rather an unwavering focus, a laser-like attention directed towards the very core of one's existence.

He distinguishes between *svarūpa*, our true nature, and *svasvarūpa*,the ultimate divine nature. This is not a separation, but rather a recognition of the inherent divinity within our own being.
