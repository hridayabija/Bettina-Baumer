## Unveiling the Threefold Rasa: A Journey into the Heart of Supreme Brahman

This commentary offers an immersive exploration of sūtra 8 from an unnamed source, guiding us through the transformative journey of integrating our inner being with the universe as understood within *Trika Shaivism*. This integration, rather than a mere philosophical concept, becomes a lived reality accessed through the transformative power of the threefold *rasa*.

### Shifting Focus: From Internal Realization to Universal Integration

The journey begins with a shift in perspective.  The preceding sūtras (1-7) directed our attention inward, emphasizing the attainment of *svarūpalābha*, the direct experience of our true nature. This involved transcending the illusions of duality and cultivating a deep inner awareness.

Sūtra 8, however, marks a pivotal turning point.  We are now guided to harmonize this internal realization with the external world, merging the profound inner experience of the Self with the vastness of the universe.  This integration, this merging of the microcosm and macrocosm, unfolds through a unique and profound understanding of *rasa*.

### The Significance of Prathama-Pratibhā-Ullāsa: The Spontaneous Impulse of the Divine

Before delving into the threefold *rasa*, it's crucial to understand the force driving this integration. The text emphasizes that it's not a result of sheer willpower or strenuous effort but rather a spontaneous unfolding orchestrated by an inner inspirational impulse known as *prathama-pratibhā-ullāsa*.

This Sanskrit term, rich in meaning, can be unpacked as follows:

* **Prathama:**  "First," indicating the primordial nature of this impulse.
* **Pratibhā:**  "Intuition" or "flash of insight," signifying its spontaneous and illuminating quality.
* **Ullāsa:** "Joy" or "expansion," suggesting the blissful and expansive nature of this inner inspiration.

*Prathama-pratibhā-ullāsa*, therefore, represents the divine spark within, the first glimmer of awareness that sets in motion the entire cosmic play of creation, preservation, and dissolution. It's the driving force behind the threefold process we're about to explore, reminding us to surrender to this innate wisdom rather than relying solely on personal effort.

### The Threefold Rasa and the Emergence of Supreme Brahman: Unveiling the Cosmic Dance

With this understanding of the spontaneous impulse guiding us, we can now delve into the heart of sūtra 8:

> **rasatrayāsvādanena anityocchalitam vigatabandham paraṃ brahma**
>
> By relishing the three essences, the unbound supreme *brahman* emerges spontaneously.

This sūtra unveils the threefold process through the evocative language of *rasa*:

* **Rasatraya:** "Three essences" or "three flavors," signifying the three distinct yet interconnected aspects of experience we'll explore.
* **Āsvādanena:** "By relishing" or "by deeply tasting," emphasizing the active and pleasurable engagement with these essences.
* **Anityocchalitam:** "Spontaneously emerging" or "effortlessly arising," highlighting the natural unfolding of this process when we align with *prathama-pratibhā-ullāsa*.
* **Vigatabandham:** "Free from bondage," indicating the liberation that accompanies this realization.
* **Paraṃ Brahma:**  "Supreme Brahman,"  referring to the ultimate reality, the infinite consciousness that pervades and transcends all phenomena.

The sūtra reveals that by fully experiencing and savoring these three essences, the supreme *brahman* reveals itself spontaneously.  We don't create this reality through effort but rather align ourselves with its natural unfolding, allowing it to emerge effortlessly within and around us.

This unveiling is further described as *rahasyakrameṇa*, a term that emphasizes the mystical and esoteric nature of this knowledge.  *Rahasyakrameṇa* suggests that this wisdom is not readily accessible through intellectual analysis but is revealed through direct experience, often transmitted through a lineage of realized masters.

### Deconstructing the Threefold Rasa:  Embracing the Cosmic Cycle

The three *rasas*, each representing a distinct flavor of reality, are anchored in three levels of support known as *ādhāra*:  *mūlādhāra*, *payodhāra*, and *ādhāra*. These levels correspond directly to the three phases of the cosmic cycle: creation, sustenance, and reabsorption.

#### 1. Mūlādhāra: The Foundation of Creation (Sṛṣṭi)

Our journey begins with *mūlādhāra*, the foundational support, the very bedrock upon which the entire universe rests.  It embodies the initial impulse of creation (*sṛṣṭi*), the primordial emergence of existence from the unmanifest. 

It's crucial to note that *mūlādhāra* here doesn't carry the same connotation as in *Haṭhayoga*, where it represents one of the *chakras* of the subtle body.  In this context, *mūlādhāra* points to a more fundamental, cosmological principle. 

*Mūlādhāra* is where the first spark of awareness ignites, symbolized by the *ahaṃ-nāda*, the primordial sound of "I am."  This is not the egoic "I" but the universal "I," the first stirring of consciousness within the vast emptiness.

Imagine a boundless ocean of pure potentiality, an unmanifest field of infinite possibilities. *Mūlādhāra* is the point at which the first ripple of awareness arises in this ocean, the first vibration that sets the cosmic dance in motion. 

This primordial sound, *ahaṃ-nāda*, doesn't just mark the beginning; it becomes the very foundation upon which the universe is projected.  It's like the blank canvas upon which the artist paints, the silent stage upon which the drama of existence unfolds.

The text uses the metaphor of *pṛthivi*, meaning "plain wall," to further illustrate this concept.  *Mūlādhāra*, like a plain wall, represents the pure, undifferentiated consciousness upon which the entire tapestry of the universe is woven.  It's the primordial ground of being, the source from which all phenomena emerge.

#### 2. Payodhāra: The Sustenance of Existence (Sthiti)

From the foundational support of *mūlādhāra*, we move to *payodhāra*, the nurturing aspect of consciousness responsible for the sustenance and preservation of all things (*sthiti*). 

*Payodhāra*, literally "support of milk," evokes a sense of nourishment, care, and continuous support.  This term, unique to this context, draws a powerful parallel between the vital nourishment a child receives from its mother's milk and the constant sustenance the universe receives from the vibrancy of the initial awakening, the *unman-maya*.

*Unman-maya* can be understood as the creative power of the Divine Mother, the energy that sustains and perpetuates all forms.  It's the force that ensures the continuation of the cosmic dance, the rhythmic pulse that keeps the universe in motion.

While *mūlādhāra* represents the initial spark, the primordial sound, *payodhāra* embodies the continuous flow of energy that sustains and nourishes all creation. It's the warmth of the sun, the flow of life-giving water, the gentle breeze that whispers through the trees - all expressions of *payodhāra*, the sustaining power of the universe.

#### 3. Ādhāra: The Withdrawal into the Absolute (Saṃhāra)

Our journey through the threefold *rasa* culminates in *ādhāra*, representing the final stage of reabsorption (*saṃhāra*).  *Ādhāra*, meaning "support" in a general sense, takes on a profound meaning in this context. It signifies the withdrawal of consciousness back into itself, the reintegration of all phenomena into the unmanifest.

Imagine the cosmic dance gradually coming to a standstill, the music fading, the dancers merging back into the stillness from which they arose.  This is the essence of *ādhāra*.  The universe, having gone through cycles of creation and sustenance, dissolves back into the primordial unity from which it emerged.

*Ādhāra* is not an annihilation of existence but a return to its source.  Just as waves eventually dissolve back into the ocean, all forms eventually merge back into the formless, the manifest back into the unmanifest.  This is not an event to be feared but a natural process, a cosmic inhalation following the exhalation of creation.

### The Esoteric Significance: Unification through Kha-Mudrā: Experiencing the Uncreated Space

Having explored the three *rasas* and their corresponding *ādhāras*, we can now grasp the profound esoteric significance of this sūtra. It's not merely a description of the cosmic cycle but a roadmap to a direct, lived experience of unity.

The text highlights the importance of savoring the wonder inherent in each of these three *rasas* (*rasatraya*). This isn't about intellectual understanding but about fully immersing ourselves in each experience, tasting its unique flavor, and recognizing its interconnectedness with the other two.

By deeply contemplating and meditating upon this unified essence of the three *rasas*, we gain access to *kha-mudrā* – the uncreated space of consciousness.  *Kha*, meaning "sky" or "ether," symbolizes the boundless, all-pervading nature of this awareness. 

This *mudrā*, identical to *khecarī-mudrā*, is revered as the highest mystical state in various yogic traditions. *Khecarī-mudrā*, literally meaning "sky-faring mudra," signifies a state of complete liberation and effortless movement within the boundless sky of consciousness.

This state arises from a complete immersion in the universal consciousness, a merging of the individual with the cosmic. It's not a temporary experience but a permanent shift in awareness, leading to the uninterrupted experience of *turīyatītā*, the fourth state of consciousness.

*Turīyatītā* is often described as the state beyond the limitations of the ordinary mind, beyond the duality of subject and object, a state of pure, unadulterated awareness. It's the realization of our true nature as pure consciousness, limitless and free.

This realization culminates in *jīvanmukta*, liberation while living. The *jīvanmukta* is no longer bound by the limitations of the ego but lives in a state of constant awareness of their true nature, radiating peace, wisdom, and compassion into the world.

### The Concept of Parama-Advāda: Embracing the Paradox of Duality and Nonduality

Central to this understanding is the concept of *parama-advāda*, the supreme nonduality, a concept unique to Kashmir Shaivism. This concept challenges the limitations of traditional nondual philosophies by embracing the paradox of duality within nonduality.

Most nondual traditions emphasize the ultimate reality as being beyond all duality, including the duality of subject and object, self and other. While this is true, it can sometimes lead to a rejection or devaluation of the phenomenal world, perceiving it as a mere illusion.

*Parama-advāda*, however, offers a more nuanced perspective.  It recognizes that while the ultimate reality is indeed beyond all duality, it's also the very source from which duality arises. The universe, with all its diversity and multiplicity, is not separate from this ultimate reality but rather a manifestation of it.

Imagine a dancer taking on different forms and expressions throughout a performance. Each form is unique and distinct, yet they all originate from the same dancer, the same source.  Similarly, *parama-advāda* reminds us that all phenomena, despite their apparent differences, ultimately arise from and are sustained by the same underlying reality, the supreme Brahman.

This understanding allows us to embrace the world with a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation, recognizing the divine dance in every aspect of creation. We no longer need to deny or reject the world but can fully engage with it, knowing that it's an expression of the same consciousness that resides within us.

### Swami Lakshman Joo's Interpretation: The Three Rasas as Energies

Swami Lakshman Joo, a renowned scholar and master of Kashmir Shaivism, offers an alternative interpretation of the three *rasas*, aligning them with the three fundamental energies: will, knowledge, and action.  He describes the experience of the three *rasas* as a progressive unfolding:

**1. First Rasa: The Will to Include:**

This first *rasa* corresponds to the energy of will, specifically the will to include the entire universe within our own being.  This involves a profound shift in perspective from a limited, ego-centric view to a more expansive, all-encompassing awareness.

It's about recognizing that the universe is not separate from us but rather an intrinsic part of our own being. Just as a wave cannot exist independently of the ocean, we cannot exist independently of the cosmos. 

This realization is not merely intellectual but experiential. It involves a deep feeling of interconnectedness with all things, a sense of oneness with the entire web of life.

**2. Second Rasa: The Expansion of Knowledge:**

The second *rasa* aligns with the energy of knowledge, specifically the knowledge of our true nature as universal consciousness.  Building upon the first rasa, where we acknowledged the universe within ourselves, we now begin to grasp the true nature of that universe and, by extension, our own nature.

This involves recognizing that the universe is not merely a collection of inert objects but a vibrant expression of consciousness.  Every atom, every being, every event is imbued with this same awareness, this same life force.

This understanding expands our knowledge beyond the limitations of the rational mind and into the realm of direct experience.  We begin to perceive the interconnectedness of all things not just as a concept but as a living reality.

**3. Third Rasa:  The Action of Unification:**

The final *rasa* corresponds to the energy of action, specifically the action of unifying our individual consciousness with the universal consciousness.  This is not a physical action but an inner merging, a dissolving of the boundaries that separate us from the divine.

Having acknowledged the universe within ourselves and understood its true nature as consciousness, we now take the final step of surrendering our limited sense of self into the vastness of the Absolute.  This is the culmination of the spiritual journey, the ultimate union of the individual with the divine.

### The Delightful Integration: Rasa and Āsvādana: Savoring the Bliss of Unity

The sūtra’s choice of words, *rasa* and *āsvādana*, underscores the deeply fulfilling and joyous nature of this integration.

* **Rasa**, often translated as "essence" or "flavor," goes beyond its literal meaning.  It suggests a rich, multi-layered experience that engages our entire being.  Just as we savor the flavors of a delicious meal, we are invited to savor the flavors of the spiritual journey, each step offering its own unique taste of the divine.
* **Āsvādana**, meaning "relishing" or "savoring," emphasizes the active and participatory aspect of this process.  It's not enough to merely understand these concepts intellectually; we must actively engage with them, allowing them to penetrate our hearts and transform us from within.

The integration of the world into *brahman* is not a dry, intellectual exercise or a path of austerity and renunciation.  It's a vibrant, joyous journey of self-discovery, a celebration of our inherent unity with the universe. 

Through the threefold *rasa*, we embark on a transformative adventure that leads us from the limitations of the ego to the boundless freedom of the Absolute.  We move from a state of separation to a state of unity, experiencing the supreme bliss of *brahman*, the ultimate reality that resides within and all around us.
