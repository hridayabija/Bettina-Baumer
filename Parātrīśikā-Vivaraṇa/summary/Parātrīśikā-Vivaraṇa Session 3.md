# A Deep Dive into Abhinavagupta's Parātrīśikā Vivaraṇa: Session 3

This session delves into the heart of Abhinavagupta's *Parātrīśikā Vivaraṇa*, a commentary on the Parātrīśikā Tantra. Building on the previous session's exploration of the concept of *Anuttara* (the Absolute), we embark on a journey through the intricate landscape of the opening verse, *Devī uvāca*, uncovering its profound implications for understanding the nature of consciousness, language, and liberation.

##  The Unfolding of Revelation: *Devī uvāca* as a Mystical Dialogue

The phrase *Devī uvāca* ("The Goddess said"), seemingly simple in structure, becomes a gateway to the profound mysteries of *Trika* (the triadic system of Kashmir Shaivism). Abhinavagupta, with his characteristic insight, dissects this phrase, addressing two apparent contradictions from an *Advaitic* (non-dualistic) perspective: the use of the past tense (*uvāca*) in relation to the ever-present Absolute Consciousness and the reference to the Divine Feminine (Devi) in the third person, seemingly objectifying the ultimate subject.

### The Paradox of the Past Tense: *Paśyantī* Remembers *Parā*

The past tense in *uvāca* is not a chronological marker; rather, it signifies the descent of *Parāvāk* (Supreme Word) from its primordial, unmanifest state of *parā* to the level of *paśyantī*, the first stage of manifestation. This descent marks the emergence of temporality, a necessary condition for the unfolding of revelation.

Abhinavagupta draws a powerful analogy:

> When the glorious *parāparā* became *paśyantī* and *madhyamā* thus recollects herself - "I myself as *parā*, Devi said thus". Then, in that state of recollection shining forth in that form she regards her own *parā* state as past in accordance with the fact of difference brought about by *māyā*, because in comparison to herself that state of *paśyantī* is the commencement of *māyā*. And because of the traveling through the phases of inner senses and outer senses in the development of speech whose life consists in manifesting difference she regards the *parā* state as past. 

Just as a person recalls a past experience, bringing it into the present through memory, *paśyantī* "remembers" the *parā* state as past. This "pastness" is not chronological but ontological, acknowledging *paśyantī*'s origin in the timeless *parā*.  It highlights the paradox of revelation: it unfolds in time while remaining rooted in the eternal now.

This concept is further elucidated in the *Tantrāloka* (3.236), where Abhinavagupta describes *parāvāk* as the ontological ground of all expression:

> So this is indeed *parāvāk* — this supreme essence of Speech divine in nature, wherein are grounded ontologically, logically, and archetypally, all that expresses and all that is to be expressed — that provides the basis both for the reality of the universe and the validity of its cognisance through speech.

### The Dance of Time: From Cosmic Cycles to Yogic Moments

Abhinavagupta further illustrates this point by exploring the relativity of time itself. He highlights the vast differences between:

- **Human time:** Measured by the cycles of day and night, based on the apparent motion of the sun.
- **Brahma's time:**  Encompassing vast cosmic cycles (*kalpas*), each consisting of billions of human years.
- **Vishnu's time:**  Even more expansive than Brahma's time, inconceivable to human understanding.
- **Yogic time:**  Transcending ordinary time altogether, where the yogi's inner experience can encompass eons in a single breath.

Abhinavagupta seizes this opportunity to delve into the nature of time, emphasizing its inherent relativity. He contrasts the vastness of Brahma's day (a cosmic time cycle) with the fleeting moments of a human day, highlighting the variability of temporal experience. By highlighting this relativity, he demonstrates that the concept of "today" or "present," being conditioned and limited, cannot apply to the unconditioned, absolute consciousness (*cit*). 

> The today of Brahma is not limited by the (human) day whose division of day depends on the apparent motion of the sun. The measure of his today is determined by many *kalpas*. The day of Vishnu and others is even longer than that, and in the case of *yogis* the term day is used even for one-thousandth part of the human day on account of his inward motion of time. 

For a *yogī* absorbed in *samādhi*, a thousand years can pass in a flash, demonstrating the subjective nature of time. Abhinavagupta, in his *Mālinīvijayavārttika* (I.157), describes the state of *kālagrāsa* ("swallowing of time"), where the yogī transcends the limitations of past, present, and future, experiencing the timeless now of *anuttara*.

He concludes that time, as we perceive it, is a mental construct (*kalpanā*) irrelevant to the *antaḥmukha saṃvidātman* (introverted consciousness) that rests in the timeless Absolute. 

> ...what is time in the introverted consciousness? The essence of time consists in the experience of successive appearance and disappearance of objects. Its essence consists in the non-presence of the awareness of introverted consciousness which is timeless.

### The Third Person Dissolves:  "I, the Goddess, Said"

The use of the third person in *Devī uvāca* poses a challenge to the non-dualistic perspective. How can the Supreme Consciousness, the ultimate subject, be spoken of as an object? Abhinavagupta, drawing upon grammatical principles, reveals that *uvāca* can be understood as both the third and the first person. By restoring the first-person meaning, he dismantles the artificial separation, affirming the non-dual nature of the revelation.

This shift is not merely grammatical but signifies the core of *pratyabhijñā* (recognition). Realization is not about knowing *anuttara* as a separate entity but recognizing it as one's own true nature. 

As the editor of *Devī uvāca* states:

> This is a variation on the theme of *recognition* evoked through the solution of a grammatical problem.  Just as the first person of the perfect presupposes, so-to-speak, a splitting of the subject followed by a new integration and reconstitution of the original unity, so the Goddess starts from the state of *paśyantī-madhyamā* and finally re-affirms herself as the all-encompassing *parā*, or, in other words, as the questioner (*Devī*) and ends as the answerer (*Bhairava*).

This shift from the third to the first person ("I, the Goddess, said") underscores the profound insight that the revelation of the *Parātrīśikā* is not a distant, historical event but an ever-present unfolding within the aspirant's own consciousness.

### *Prayojana*: The Purpose of the Śāstra is Jīvanmukti

The purpose (*prayojana*) of the *śāstra*, as articulated by Abhinavagupta, is *jīvanmukti* – liberation in life.  This liberation is not a postponed promise, a reward for future actions; it is an immediate possibility, a transformation that occurs within the fabric of embodied existence.

### *Jīvanmukti*: Embracing the Dance of the Tattvas

Abhinavagupta defines *jīvanmukti* as the aspirant's full absorption (*samāveśa*) in the perfect I-consciousness of Bhairava (*bhairava-svarūpāpedāṁ*), a state achieved through the grace of the Divine *śakti* (*śaktipāta*). 

> The aim or purpose of the *śāstra* is liberation of all experience in life that divine. Nothing less experience we have become entitled for this knowledge of the unsurpassable *anuttara* derived from grace in the form of the excellent descent of divine *śakti* - *śāktipāt*. This liberation from its penetration with complete identity in the essential nature of *Bhairava* and unification with perfect I-consciousness, which is a delightful flash of one's own essential self and is the achievement of one who by the realization of his essential nature regards the entire multitude of the categories of existence supposed to be bondage as merely different aspects of his sportfulness, which is the expression of the abundance of his delight.

This realization is not merely intellectual but experiential, an absorption (*hṛdayāṅgīkārāt*) of one's true nature in the Heart (*hṛdaya*). The *jīvanmukta* perceives the entire spectrum of reality, encompassing the 36 *tattvas* (levels of reality), as a playful self-expression (*svātma-camatkāra-pūrṇamatvā*) of the Divine.

This *playfulness*, as described in the *Tantrāloka* (1.192), signifies the inherent freedom and creativity of the Absolute Consciousness:

> "Play is that activity which is done for its own sake, for the sheer joy of doing it."

The *jīvanmukta*'s life becomes a spontaneous dance with the Divine, a continuous expression of the Heart's boundless joy and freedom.

### *Ahaṃtā*: The Wonder of Full Consciousness

Central to this realization is the concept of *ahaṃtā*, the "I-ness" that constitutes the fullness of consciousness. This *ahaṃtā* is characterized by *camatkāra* (wonder), a sense of awe and amazement at the boundless nature of the Self.

Abhinavagupta, drawing on the *Śivasūtras*' dictum *"Viṣmayo yogabhūmikāḥ"* ("Wonder is the characteristic of the stages of yoga"), emphasizes the importance of *camatkāra* as a sign of authentic spiritual experience:

> We are speaking of the *ahaṃtā*. Especially *ahaṃ*. And which is the fullness of our consciousness to the *ahaṃtā*, which is a state of wonder. It is surprising one is struck by that fullness. *Svatma-camatkāra pūrṇa-ahaṃ pūrṇa-ahaṃtā*. That that mean being one completely completely one with the fullness of our consciousness. 

This *camatkāra*, this sense of wonder, arises from recognizing the *ahaṃ* as the source of all experience, the ever-present witness that pervades and illuminates the entire cosmos.

## *Anuttara*: Deconstructing the Absolute Through Sixteen Lenses

Abhinavagupta, in his commentary, provides sixteen different interpretations of the word *anuttara*, each highlighting a unique facet of the Absolute. This meticulous deconstruction serves not to limit or define *anuttara* but to reveal its boundless nature, its ability to transcend all conceptual frameworks.

### The Power of Negation: Avoiding Fixation and Embracing Openness

The very structure of the word *anuttara*, a negation of the comparative (*uttara*), signifies its refusal to be confined within a hierarchy. It suggests an open-ended transcendence, a reality beyond all comparison and limitation. This use of negation is a common strategy in non-dualistic philosophies, freeing the mind from clinging to specific attributes and opening it to the infinite possibilities of the Absolute.

### Anuttara and the Tattvas: The Interplay of Cosmos, Human, and Divine

Abhinavagupta's first interpretation places *anuttara* beyond the entire cosmotheandric universe, encompassing the realms of cosmos, human, and divine, as represented by the 36 *tattvas*. 

These *tattvas*, far from being independent entities, are interconnected and interpenetrating, each containing the essence of all others according to the principle of *sarvam sarvātmakam*.  

In his *Iśvarapratyabhijñā Vivṛtivimarśinī* (III.2), he defines *tattva* as:

> …that which, as a cause of the grouping of several entities, appears to be one and indivisible, as for instance, earth (*pṛthivī*) in the case of mountains, trees, cities, etc., and water (*ap*) in the case of rivers, lakes, oceans, etc. 

*Anuttara*, then, is not merely "more" than the *tattvas*; it is their very source and substance, the underlying reality that pervades and sustains all levels of existence.

###  Anuttara as Experience: Freedom, Wonder, and the Dissolution of Need

Abhinavagupta consistently emphasizes that *anuttara* is not a concept to be intellectually grasped but a state of being to be realized experientially. Its core attributes are *svātantrya* (absolute freedom) and *camatkāra* (wonder). 

He describes *anuttara* as *anākula* (unbolted, unrestricted) and *anapekṣa* (non-dependent), a state of pure joy and surprise where the aspirant finds complete fulfillment. 

He cautions against approaching *anuttara* with preconceived notions or desires, as these create obstacles to its realization. In his commentary on verse 7, he criticizes the pursuit of *anuttara* through external means:

> If it is said that God's will is perfect, it is not open to discussion, then enough of useless efforts like reading and concentrating on books, exposition, discussion, etc. This heavy burden should certainly be abandoned. 

He stresses the importance of recognizing the ever-presence of *anuttara*, its inherent nature as the very ground of our being.

### Anuttara in Daily Life:  The Subtle Rain and the Hidden Treasure

Abhinavagupta, using a striking metaphor from his own *stotra* (hymn), emphasizes that *anuttara*:

> "*Pratanu-vr̥ṣṭi-patanāmbudhiḥ śikhara-sthāne viṭata iva nabhasi |
> na sa bhāti śikharastha-jñāna-vat sarvathā bhavati ca sphuṭam ||"*

> "Thin rain falling incessantly is not perceptible in the vast expanse of the sky — but it becomes clearly visible against the background of trees of the forest and the roof of houses. Even so the Supreme Bhairava, who is extremely subtle, never appears within the range of experience." (PTV, p.8)

Just as the subtle rain, invisible against the vastness of the sky, becomes perceptible against the backdrop of trees and houses, *anuttara*, though ever-present, often goes unnoticed amidst the clamor of our thoughts and desires. 

This subtle presence is further evoked through the analogy of a hidden treasure:

> The dawning of the Light is like finding a lost treasure: the state of universal non-duality. (Anuttarāṣṭikā, v. 4)

*Anuttara* is not something to be sought outside ourselves; it is a treasure already present within, waiting to be unearthed through the practice of *pratyabhijñā* (recognition).

## The Sixteen Interpretations: A Multifaceted Approach to the Absolute

Abhinavagupta's sixteen interpretations of *anuttara*, woven together like threads in a tapestry, create a rich and nuanced understanding of the Absolute. Each interpretation, while seemingly independent, points towards the same fundamental truth, revealing the interconnectedness of all things and the pervasiveness of *anuttara* within every aspect of reality.

Some of the key themes that emerge from these interpretations include:

* **The Transcendence of Duality:** *Anuttara* denies all dualities, including bondage and liberation, world and Self, question and answer, higher and lower.
* **The All-Encompassing Nature of Consciousness:** *Anuttara* is the ground of all experience, the source of both the *vikalpas* (thought-constructs) and the *nirvikalpa* (thought-free) states.
* **The Interconnectedness of All Things:** *Sarvam sarvātmakam* – everything is interconnected and interpenetrating, reflecting the *anuttara*'s inherent wholeness.
* **The Role of Grace and Effort:** *Anuttara* is ultimately realized through a combination of divine grace (*śaktipāta*) and the aspirant's sincere effort (*sādhanā*).

## From Anuttara to Manifestation:  Kaulikasiddhi and Khecarīsamatā

The Devi's question in the Parātrīśikā's opening verse seeks to understand how *anuttara*, the Absolute, manifests as the universe, and how the aspirant can realize this unity within their own being.  This inquiry leads to the concepts of *kaulikasiddhi* and *khecarīsamatā*.

### Kaulikasiddhi:  The Embodied Realization of Wholeness

*Kaulikasiddhi* refers to the aspirant's attainment of perfect union with the *kula*, the "embodied cosmos." It is the realization of the divine potential within the physical body, the recognition that the *kula* itself is a manifestation of *anuttara*.

Abhinavagupta, in his *Tantrāloka* (XIII.6-7), describes the *kula* as a microcosm of the universe, containing within itself all the divine energies:

> Thus the body should be seen as full of all the paths, filled with varied operations of time, and the seat of all the movements of time and of space. The body seen in this way is in itself composed of all the divinities, and thus must be made an object of contemplation, of adoration, and of the rites of fulfillment. He who penetrates in the body achieves liberation.

### Kaulikasiddhi:  Two Perspectives on the Dance of Consciousness

Abhinavagupta offers two distinct perspectives on *kaulikasiddhi*, reflecting the dynamic interplay between *anuttara* and the *kula*:

**1.  Extroversive Kaulikasiddhi:  The Perfection of Perception**

From the extroversive perspective, *kaulikasiddhi* signifies the perfection of perception. It is the ability to experience the world with clarity and certainty, recognizing the divine energy pulsating within every sensation. 

Abhinavagupta explains that the *kula* (mind-body complex) acts as the instrument of perception, but its power stems from the indwelling consciousness of *anuttara*.  It is the divine energy that animates the senses, allowing for an unclouded experience of both the external and internal worlds.

> Kaulika-siddhi means *siddhi* or achievement of definite experience of objects derived through *kula* i.e. by means of the body, *prāṇa*, and *puryaṣṭaka*. The *siddhi* (achievement) consists in the definite grasp of blue, pleasure, etc. (i.e., objective and subjective experience) which are completely diverse (lit., whose life consists of diversity).  (PTV, p. 33)

**2.  Introversive Kaulikasiddhi:  The Return to the Heart**

From the introversive perspective, *kaulikasiddhi* represents the aspirant's return to the source, their realization of oneness with *anuttara*. This involves transcending the limitations of the *kula*, recognizing it as a solidified form (*ghanatā*) of the Absolute Consciousness.

Abhinavagupta uses the analogy of water freezing into ice. While appearing different, ice is still water at its core. Similarly, the *kula*, though seemingly separate, is ultimately an expression of *anuttara*, its solidity a temporary veil over the fluidity of the Divine.

This introversive *kaulikasiddhi* is a state of *ānanda* (bliss) achieved by turning inward (*parivṛtya*) and recognizing the perfect I-consciousness as one's true nature: 

>  *Siddhi* or achievement is the acquisition of bliss (*ānanda*) by turning round (*parivṛtya*) to have a firm hold on that very principle, i.e., the light of the universal consciousness (*tathātva-dārḍhyaṃ*), in other words, identity with the perfect I-feeling of *Śiva*, who is the highest Consciousness and whose nature is *spanda* or the eternal throb of delight in manifestation (*hṛdaya-svabhāva-para-saṃvidātmaka-śiva-vimarśa-tādātmyam*). (PTV, p. 32)

This realization leads to a profound shift in perception, where the limitations of the *kula* dissolve, and the aspirant experiences the world as a radiant expression of *anuttara*.

### Khecarīsamatā: The Dance of Freedom in the Boundless Sky

*Khecarīsamatā* is the culmination of the aspirant's journey towards wholeness – the union with *khecarī*, the Divine Consciousness-Power that moves freely in the boundless expanse of awareness, symbolized by *kha* (sky, void).

This *khecarī*, the dynamic force of the Absolute, manifests in various forms throughout the cosmotheandric reality:

* As **vyomacarī**: It resides in the undifferentiated void of pure consciousness.
* As **gocarī**: It animates the *antaḥkaraṇa* (inner psychic apparatus), facilitating perception and knowledge.
* As **dikcarī**: It activates the senses, allowing for interaction with the external world.
* As **bhūcarī**: It manifests as the tangible forms and objects of the universe.

Abhinavagupta, in his Parātrīśikā Vivaraṇa (p. 39), clarifies the interconnectedness of these manifestations:

>  Similarly, in the individual aspects, the *śaktis* that are known successively as *vyomacarī* in the void (of consciousness) in which the distinction between subject and object has not yet appeared, as *gocarī* in the form of *antaḥkaraṇa* in which there is just appearance of knowledge, as *dikcarī* in the form of the outer senses suggesting the appearance of diversity in which state there is diversity of the knower from the knowable object, as *bhūcarī* in the form of *bhāvas* or existents in which there is preponderance of clear diversity in the objects, are in reality, according to the principle enunciated, non-distinct from *khecarī* which abides in the essential nature i.e. *anuttara*. Thus that Śakti of the Supreme Lord is only one.

### From *Vaiṣamya* to *Samatā*:  Transforming Perception Through Recognition

The aspirant's challenge lies in moving from *vaiṣamya* (disparity, disharmony) to *samatā* (sameness, harmony) in their relationship with *khecarī*.  This *vaiṣamya* arises from mistaking the limited self for the true Self, perceiving thoughts, emotions, and sensations as separate from the universal Consciousness-Power.

Abhinavagupta, in his commentary on verse 1 of the Parātrīśikā, emphasizes the transformative power of *pratyabhijñā* (recognition):

> Even an iota of the ignorance of the nature of the integral *anuttara* amounts to a contrary state of the mind. It is this contrary state that constitutes transmigratory existence (*saṁsāra*).

This "contrary state" is the experience of *vaiṣamya*, a sense of separation and limitation.  The path to *samatā* lies in recognizing the divine essence within every experience, even those perceived as negative or undesirable. 

### The Alchemy of Transformation: From Passion to Divine Play

Abhinavagupta, drawing on the wisdom of Somānanda's *Śivadr̥ṣṭi* (VII.105), illustrates how even seemingly negative experiences can become pathways to *khecarīsamatā*:

> "Whether it is the state of pleasure (the expression of *sattva*) or of pain (the expression of *rajas*), or of delusion (the expression of *tamas*), I abide in all of them as the Supreme Śiva."

He further explores the example of passion (*kāma*), demonstrating how it can be transmuted from a source of *vaiṣamya* into an expression of *khecarī*, leading to blissful union with *anuttara*. This transformation involves not suppression but recognition – understanding the true nature of passion as a manifestation of the divine creative energy.

## Embracing the Heart: Summary Verses as Guiding Lights

The session concludes with summary verses that encapsulate the essence of Abhinavagupta's teachings on the *hṛdaya* (Heart) and the path to *jīvanmukti*.

> The worship of this central reality (*hṛdaya-bīja*) is ever present, it is attained everywhere, in any country, with any substance, in any activity, location, or knowledge certain beyond doubt.

> That in which, whether meditating, remembering, reflecting, or acting, everything comes to rest, and from which everything comes forth in manifestation: that is the Heart.

These verses emphasize the Heart as the ultimate sanctuary, the *pratiṣṭhādhāma* (foundational abode) of both *prasāra* (expansion) and *saṃhāra* (withdrawal). By dwelling in the Heart, the aspirant transcends the limitations of the *kula*, experiencing the boundless freedom and *ānanda* of *anuttara*.

### The Liberating Power of Sat-tarka: Unveiling the Sun of Consciousness

Abhinavagupta highlights the importance of *sat-tarka* (right reasoning, contemplation) in dissolving the mental obscurations (*mala*) that cloud the aspirant's perception. 

> The aspirant is established in the essential nature of the Self immediately after *sat-tarka* (right reasoning, contemplation) and, therefore, the specks of cloud that cover the sun of consciousness are dissolved automatically by the savor of delight that the aspirant experiences at this moment.

This *sat-tarka*, guided by the teachings of the *āgamas* and the grace of the guru, helps the aspirant to recognize the Heart as their true home, the radiant source of their being.

## Conclusion: A Journey Toward the Heart

This session's exploration of *Devī uvāca*, with its emphasis on *pratyabhijñā*, *jīvanmukti*, and the transformative power of *jñāna*, provides a firm foundation for understanding the remaining verses of the *Parātrīśikā*, where Abhinavagupta outlines the practical steps for realizing *anuttara*.

His commentary, a masterful blend of tradition and experience, unveils the *hṛdayabīja* as a potent tool for awakening to our true nature as *Śiva*, guiding us towards a life of embodied liberation, where every moment becomes a dance with the Divine.
