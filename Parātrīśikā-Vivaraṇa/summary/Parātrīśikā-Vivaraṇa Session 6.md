## Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa Session 6: Summary and Retelling

This session delves into the concept of *kecarī* and its manifestations in human experience. It explores the interplay between *kecarī*, emotions, sense perception, and the union of *śiva* and *śakti*.

### Opening Invocations

The session commences with two invocations in Sanskrit:

**First Invocation:**

> **Premalākṣayā vinava sṛṣṭi mahārjananī  
> Bharitatnuśca pañcamukha goptaruci janakaḥ  
> Tadubhayāmalasphuratāvāviśargamamyaṁ  
> Hṛdaya manutararāṃṛtakolam  
> Mamasaṁsphuratām** 

This invocation can be interpreted on two levels:

* **Cosmological Interpretation:** It invokes the Supreme Consciousness, *anuttara*, represented as a union (*yāmala*) of the Divine Mother (*jananī*) and Father (*janakaḥ*). The Mother is characterized by pure, boundless creation (*vimalakalāśrayābhinavasṛṣṭimahā*), while the Father embodies completeness and expresses His creative power through five faces (*bharitatnuśca pañcamukha goptaruci*).  Their union manifests as a vibrant, ever-expanding reality (*tadubhayāmalasphuratāvāviśargamamyaṁ*), which is the ultimate source of immortality (*anuttarāṃṛtakulaṃ*). The invocation concludes with a prayer for the flourishing of the heart (*hṛdaya*) as the embodiment of this cosmic bliss.

* **Personal Interpretation:** This invocation can also be understood as a prayer by Abhinavagupta for the flourishing of his own heart (*mama saṃsphuratāt*), which is filled with the supreme nectar of *anuttara*. He connects this personal realization to the union of his parents, symbolizing the union of *śiva* and *śakti* on a human level. His mother, Vimalā (*vimalakalāśrayā*) is depicted as filled with the joy of creation (*abhinavasṛṣṭimahā*), while his father, Narasiṁhagupta (*pañcamukhaguptaruciḥ*), embodies completeness (*bharitatnuśca*).

**Second Invocation:**

> **Asmadrūpasamāveṣṭaha svātmanātmanivāraṇe śivaḥ karotu nijayā namaḥ śaktyātmāne**

This invocation, repeated four times, is a prayer for *śiva* to bestow grace and remove the veil of self-obstruction (*svātmanātmanivāraṇe*) through his inherent power (*śakti*) so that the true nature of the self (*ātman*) may be revealed. It emphasizes the non-dual nature of *śiva* and *śakti*, highlighting their interconnectedness in the process of liberation.

### Introduction to *Kecarī*

*Kecarī* is a Sanskrit term used to describe the free movement of consciousness, often likened to a bird soaring in the limitless sky. This session delves into the concept of *kecarī*, its association with freedom (*svātantrya*), and its manifestations in various aspects of human experience, including emotions and sense perception. 

### *Kecarī Samatā* and *Kecarī Vaiṣamyā*

*Kecarī* can manifest in two distinct ways:

**1. *Kecarī Samatā*:**

* This refers to the **positive** aspect of *kecarī*, signifying **harmony** and **balance** with the power of consciousness. In this state, the individual's consciousness is aligned with the divine consciousness, and they experience a sense of unity with the *cit*.

**2. *Kecarī Vaiṣamyā*:**

* This represents the **negative** aspect of *kecarī*, characterized by a **lack of harmony**, **inequality**, and **imbalance** with the power of consciousness. In this state, the individual's consciousness is disconnected from the divine consciousness, and they experience a sense of separation and limitation.

To illustrate these contrasting states, Abhinavagupta uses the example of *kāmakrodhā* (desire and anger), two powerful emotions that can either lead to *samatā* (harmony) or *vaiṣamyā* (disharmony).

### *Vaiṣamyā* and the *Malas*

*Vaiṣamyā*, or the lack of harmony with *kecarī*, arises from ignorance (*ajñatā*) of the true nature of the Absolute (*anuttara*). Abhinavagupta states that even the slightest ignorance of the integral, partless (*akālakalita*), and untainted nature of the absolute constitutes *vaiṣamyā*.

This *ajñāna* is the root of all evil (*aprajñāna*) and the source of *saṁsāra*, the cycle of birth and death.

**The Trimalas:**

This *aprajñāna* is further associated with the *trimalas*, three impurities that obscure the true nature of the Self:

**1. *Āṇavamala***:

* This *mala* arises from considering oneself incomplete (*apūrṇatva*) or imperfect (*apūrṇa abhimāna*), leading to a constant desire to fill the perceived lack.  It is characterized by a sense of limitation and a yearning for external fulfillment.

**2. *Māyiyamala***:

* This *mala* stems from the perception of differences and duality (*bheda*) between oneself and others, the spiritual and material, God and man. It creates a sense of separation and fosters attachment to the illusory world of appearances.

**3. *Karmamala***:

* This *mala* results from differentiating between good and evil (*śubha-aśubha*) based on accumulated *karma* and past experiences. It binds the individual to the cycle of action and reaction, perpetuating *saṁsāra*.

In non-dualistic Śaivism, however, these *malas* are not seen as substantial entities but rather as aspects of ignorance (*ajñāna*) that can be removed through the acquisition of true knowledge (*prajñāna*). This knowledge arises from recognizing the non-dual nature of reality and the inherent unity of the Self with *śiva*.

### *Samatā* and the Integration of Emotions

When the disharmony (*vaiṣamyā*) caused by the non-recognition of the essential nature ceases, even seemingly negative emotions like anger and delusion (*krodha-moha-ādi*) appear as expressions of the divine consciousness. This is because, in the state of *samatā*, the individual recognizes that all experiences, both pleasant and unpleasant, are ultimately manifestations of *śiva*.

**Support from the *Spanda Kārikā*:**

This concept is supported by quotes from the *Spanda Kārikā*, a foundational text of Kashmir Shaivism:

* **"*Śivāyaḥ*."** This phrase highlights the dynamism of *śiva*, emphasizing that His very nature is to expand His consciousness. It suggests that even seemingly negative experiences, when seen through the lens of *samatā*, can contribute to the expansion of consciousness.

* **"*Suka dukhe same kṛtvā sthito'ham iti paramparayā śivaḥ*."**  This quote emphasizes the equanimity of the realized being (*śiva*) who remains unmoved by the fluctuations of joy and sorrow. It highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced state of consciousness regardless of external circumstances.

**Savikalpaka vs. Nirvikalpaka:**

The difference between emotions leading to *samatā* (harmony) or *vaiṣamyā* (disharmony) lies in the distinction between *savikalpaka* and *nirvikalpaka*. *Savikalpaka* refers to a state of consciousness where the individual identifies with their thoughts and emotions, experiencing them as separate from the *cit*. In contrast, *nirvikalpaka* denotes a state of consciousness free from thought projections and identifications, allowing the individual to experience emotions as manifestations of the divine consciousness without getting caught in their duality.

### The Role of the Senses and *Śobha*

Abhinavagupta challenges the traditional view that the senses and emotions are obstacles to spiritual progress. He emphasizes the positive role of emotions, stating that even strong emotions are necessary for both artistic and spiritual experiences. He argues that emotions, when experienced in harmony with the *cit*, can actually facilitate the expansion of consciousness and lead to a deeper understanding of reality.

**The Concept of *Śobha*:**

To illustrate this point, Abhinavagupta introduces the concept of *śobha*, which can be translated as "agitation" or "creative excitement." He explains that *śobha* is an essential ingredient in the process of manifestation. 

* *Śobha* as a Creative Push: Just as *śiva* would not create the universe without the motivating force of *śakti*, so too, human creativity requires the agitation of *śobha*. Without *śobha*, there would be no artistic inspiration, no passionate pursuit of knowledge, no transformative experiences.

* *Śobha* and the Divine: *Śobha* is not merely a human phenomenon; it is a reflection of the dynamism of *śiva*.  It represents the creative impulse that surges through the cosmos, driving evolution and inspiring every act of manifestation. 

### Sexuality and Creativity

Expanding on the concept of *śobha*, Abhinavagupta delves into the analysis of sexuality within the context of yoga. He emphasizes that sexual energy is a powerful force that can be harnessed for spiritual growth. He argues that sexual desire, when transcended and transformed, can become a pathway to liberation.

**Psychosomatic Aspects of *Virya*:**

Abhinavagupta discusses the psychosomatic aspects of sexual energy (*virya*), explaining how it is connected to the life energy (*caitanya rūpeṇa prāṇa rūpam*) in the central channel (*suṣumna*) and how it manifests as *ojas*, the vital force that sustains life and empowers the senses. 

**Sensory Perceptions and *Virya*:**

He explains how exciting sensory perceptions can arouse and agitate the sexual power (*virya*), leading to the excitement of other senses as well. This interconnectedness is highlighted through the maxim "*sarvam sarvatmakam*", emphasizing the holistic nature of experience where every part is inextricably linked to the whole.

### The Source of Pleasure and Grief

Abhinavagupta posits that the source of all pleasure, whether derived from love, aesthetic experiences, or other forms of enjoyment, is ultimately the supreme I consciousness (*pūrṇahaṁ*). This divine consciousness is the source of all energies, which can manifest as either positive or negative depending on one's level of awareness and harmony with the *cit*.

**Analysis of Grief:**

He also analyzes grief (*śoka*), explaining how the pleasure derived from attachment to loved ones can turn into sorrow when there is an apprehension of loss. This transformation highlights the inherent duality of the *savikalpaka* state where pleasure and pain are experienced as separate and opposing forces.

**Grief into Joy:**

However, Abhinavagupta argues that even grief can be transformed into joy (*śoka vikāsa*) when it reaches its climax and despair sets in. In that moment of intense suffering, the individual's sense of separation dissolves, and they are thrown into the unity of the *cit śakti*. This transformation occurs through the dissolution of duality (*dvita kalane*) and the merging of the *prāṇa* and *apāna* in the central channel (*suṣumṇa*), leading to a state of non-dual awareness.

### Sensual Experience and the Recognition of Self

Abhinavagupta asserts that even sensual experiences can become a pathway to self-realization. He explains that when experienced with awareness, sensual pleasures can serve as a reminder of the inherent delight of the divine self. This is because they are not simply dependent on the physical body but are ultimately derived from the energy of *śiva-śakti*.

* **Momentary glimpses of unity:** In moments of intense sensual enjoyment, the individual can experience a fleeting glimpse of the unity of consciousness, a taste of the bliss that lies beyond the limitations of the ego.

* **Pathway to the unutterable:** These experiences can serve as a catalyst for seeking a more profound and lasting union with the Divine. They can inspire the individual to transcend the limitations of the senses and seek the eternal, unutterable state realized through the harmonious union with the expansive energy of the perfect high consciousness (*parā prakāśa rūpe*).

### The Seed of the Banyan Tree

Abhinavagupta concludes the discussion of *kecarī samatā* with two symbolic references:

* **The Banyan Tree:** He quotes a verse comparing the creative power of *śiva* to the seed of a banyan tree. This simile highlights the potential for vast expansion contained within a seemingly insignificant seed. Just as a tiny seed can give rise to a massive tree, so too, the awareness of the *hṛdayabīja* (the seed of the heart) can lead to the realization of the all-encompassing nature of *śiva*.

* **Rudrayāmala Verse 88:** He quotes the last verse of the *Rudrayāmala*, which emphasizes the union of *śiva* and *śakti* at the lower levels of human experience while remaining connected to *paraśiva*. This verse suggests that even the most mundane experiences can be transformed into pathways to liberation when experienced with the awareness of the underlying unity of consciousness.

### Concluding Remarks

Abhinavagupta summarizes the commentary on the first verse of the *Parātrīśikā*, emphasizing the following key points:

* **Anuttara as the Source:** *Anuttara*, the Absolute, is the source of *kaulikasiddhi*, the perfection of totality, and *kecarīsamatā*, the harmonious state of the power of consciousness.
* **Interconnectedness of Concepts:** The concepts of *śiva-śakti*, emotions, sense perception, and the states of *vikalpa* and *nirvikalpa* are intricately interconnected and ultimately inseparable.
* **Importance of Experience:** Realization arises not merely from intellectual understanding but from direct, personal experience (*anubhava*).
* **The Path Ahead:** The second part of the Devī’s question, to be explored in the next session, will delve deeper into the practical methods for achieving *kecarīsamatā*.


**Abhinavagupta's concluding remarks** on the first verse of the *Parātrīśikā* emphasize the key concepts explored in this session:

> "*Amṛteśvara trikaśāstra rahasya upadesha kartaḥ tat paśyati tat paśyati tāve tat vibhāvām anuttarāṃ kaulika siddhi kāṃ yena yena jñātam yena jñātam yena chit samvit tata uttamam*." 

This translates to: "Amṛteśvara, the teacher of the secret of the Trika doctrine, he sees that.  He perceives that radiance of *anuttara*, the *kaulika siddhi*, through which, by which alone, by which the *cit samvit*, by that is the highest."

He highlights the importance of seeing and perceiving the radiance of *anuttara*, the perfection of totality (*kaulikasiddhi*), which can only be achieved through the realization of the true nature of consciousness (*cit samvit*).

### General Conclusion

This session provides a profound exploration of *kecarī*, highlighting its connection to the interplay of emotions, sense perception, and the union of *śiva* and *śakti*. Abhinavagupta skillfully uses examples from everyday experience and yogic practice to illustrate the transformative power of recognizing the underlying unity of consciousness in all aspects of life. The session concludes with an anticipation of moving toward more practical methods for achieving *kecarīsamatā* in the upcoming sessions.
