## Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa Session 7: A Detailed Summary and Retelling

This document provides a comprehensive summary and retelling of Session 7 of the Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa, focusing on the dialogue between Devi and Parameśvara, particularly on the concept of *Samatā* and the nature of *Kula* and *Kauliki śakti*. The summary is structured into subtopics, retaining all essential information and keywords from the original text.

### **1. Initial Reflections on Disasters and the Importance of *Samatā***

The session begins with reflections on recent natural disasters and the significance of *Samatā* (equality, harmony) in this context. It is suggested that engaging with spiritual traditions like the Trika system is not an escape from worldly realities, but rather a path toward realizing *Samatā* and potentially mitigating disharmony in the world.

*   **Connecting Disasters to *Vaiṣamyā***: The author observes a possible correlation between the increasing frequency of natural disasters and the growing *vaiṣamyā* (inequality, disharmony) in the world, suggesting that these disasters could be nature's reaction to this imbalance.

> *"And, uh, this whole sequence of earthquake, flood, or this, we are suffering so many natural disasters, etc. something like that. It was an earthquake and war violence. So, our aim that teach this *Samatā* is very serious for our own integration and for the integration of the whole world."*

*   **Spiritual Practice as a Response**: The author emphasizes that engaging with spiritual traditions like the Trika system is not an escape from worldly realities, but rather a path towards realizing *Samatā*, which can contribute to reducing disharmony in the world.

> *"And, that is why, um, going deep into such a spiritual tradition, should never be seen as escaping from this worldly realities. That also way to go to to reach state of *Samatā*. And if we reach it then it will reduce a lot. So, that is how we should not be disconnected, even though, not from this TV or anything like that. It's enough to know. And, then, to take it inside and internalize them. Make our spiritual practice more serious, more responsible."*

*   **The Role of Individuals in Achieving *Samatā***: The author highlights that achieving *Samatā* is not solely the responsibility of political leaders or saints but requires the contribution of every individual.

> *"It sounds pretentious, but it is not, because, every individual and they know who must change the world? Not the politicians, or the Saints. So, everyone contributes to this *Samatā*. Freedom, individual."*

### **2. Understanding *Kula* and its Significance**

The author introduces the concept of *Kula*, using a definition by his guru, Swami Lakṣmaṇjū, to highlight its significance within the Shaiva *Saṃpradāya*.

*   **Lakṣmaṇjū's Definition of *Kula***: 

    > *"The *Kula* system teaches you how you can live in eternity, your universal consciousness, the real nature of yourself. Both ascending and the descending act. Why do you rise from the lowest to the highest? You realize your nature. And, why descend from the highest to the lowest, you realize your nature. In the *Kula* system, there is no break in the realization of your own nature. Either, in the highest circle or the lowest circle. This system, therefore, teaches you how you can live in totality. That totality is the translation of *Kula*. In fact, the word "*Kula*" means "totality." In the practice of the *Kula* system, you have to realize the totality of the universe in one party. Take one particle of anything which exists in this world. That one particle is to be realize the totality of the whole universe. The totality, totality energy is found one particle. Everything is full of one thing and one thing is full of all things."*

This definition emphasizes the core tenets of *Kula*:

    * **Realizing Universal Consciousness:** *Kula* focuses on recognizing the eternal, universal consciousness as one's true nature.
    * **Ascending and Descending Acts:** Both the upward movement towards the Divine and the downward movement into manifestation are part of realizing this nature.
    * **Totality:** *Kula* signifies living in the awareness of totality, understanding that everything is interconnected and contains the essence of everything else.
    * **Realizing Totality in Each Particle:** The practice involves recognizing the totality of the universe within even the smallest particle of existence.

*   **Connection to the Shaiva *Saṃpradāya***: The author explicitly states that Lakṣmaṇjū's definition encapsulates the core idea of the traditional Shaiva *Saṃpradāya*, which is rooted in the consciousness of *Kula*.

> *"And, this, of course summarizes the whole central idea of the traditional Shaiva *Saṃpradāya*. Which is very much a *Kula*, *Kula* consciousness, Shaiva *Saṃpradāya*. This what it says here."*

### **3. Devi's Question and the Concept of *Guhya***

The session then examines Devi's question in the Parātrīśikā, highlighting the concept of *guhya* (secret) and its nuanced interpretation within the Tantric context.

*   **Devi's Knowledge**: The author points out that Devi, being an advanced disciple, already possesses knowledge of the *guhyaṃ mahāguhyaṃ* (the secret, the great secret), indicating her high level of spiritual understanding.

> *"And, now, the question of Devi continues in one and a half verses... As it is obvious from the very first part of the question, the Devi knows, the Devi knows, and then what is she aiming at? It comes clear in the second verse. And, that she knows is very clear that one sentence. It that *guhyaṃ mahāguhyaṃ gatayasya mahāpadaṃ*. See, even if if you are a very advanced disciple, still, you should go to your *Guru*. She is the most advanced disciple, but still she, she says Devi knows this secret, this great secret."*

*   **The Double Meaning of *Mahāguhya***: The author draws attention to the deliberate play on the double meaning of *mahā-aguhyaṃ*, which can be interpreted both as "great secret" and "great non-secret". This duality is characteristic of the Tantric approach, where secrecy and clarity coexist. 

> *"Now, this is the ingenuity of Tantric exegesis, that why why should she repeat *mahāguhyaṃ*? The *guhyaṃ* is already there. Because, it has a double meaning, *mahā-aguhyaṃ*. And this is the whole, uh, the secrecy of the Tantras and their complete clarity. They, they are simultaneous."*

*   **Secrecy and Purity**: The text suggests that the secrecy surrounding Tantric teachings is not absolute but rather depends on the disciple's spiritual capacity and purity. For a purified disciple, the secret becomes *apuguhyaṃ* (not hidden).

> *"And, it depends on the capacity of the disciple, the purity. Because, it is also said that the disciple must be purified by all sorts of descent of grace. And, then only, you can realize that it is actually *apuguhyaṃ*. It is not hidden."*

*   **Universality of Tantric Revelation**: The author argues that while Tantric teachings might appear esoteric, the reality they reveal is universally known. The distinction lies in recognition – the initiated recognize it explicitly through their practice and guidance, while others might know it implicitly through their lived experience.

> *"So this is the universality of the Tantric revelation or though this so to say only for the initiated and only for the healing the whole spiritual world actually But this is what they say it is not that kind of esoteric reality but the same reality is that is known to everyone Only of course the difference may be that it is not recognized that that is why we recognize this But it is known to everyone that whenever they cannot drive a a this beautiful toward the end of us not the beginning This is even the the simple villager they know it Everybody knows it And therefore Going to the other extreme order and bringing from the the *Atma* mind that they know it They know this answer They know this because they cannot leave that"*

*   **The Example of *Anuttara***: To illustrate this point, the author uses the concept of *Anuttara* (supreme, unsurpassed). *Anuttara* is not something exclusive to the Tantras; it is inherently known to everyone because it is essentially *Karma* (action, life) itself, which everyone experiences.

> *"Because one of the definitions of *Anuttara* is precisely life Karma So who doesn't live Or if you are not aware that is doubtful But it is definitely known to everyone This consciousness is everybody"* 

*   **Consciousness and the *Ātman***: Further elucidating this connection between universal truth and individual experience, the author states that consciousness, in its purest form, is the *Ātman* (self). The *Ātman* serves as the foundation for all knowing, for knowledge itself, and for the objects that are known.

> *"Now Now what those in the its ultimate analysis if it is the consciousness should be the *Atma* itself What writes and divides in the different states of knowing knowledge and knowing the objects objects Now should be the *Atma* is should be the *Atma*"*

*   **Maya and *Śuddhavidyā***:  The discussion then explores the relationship between *Maya* (illusion) and *Śuddhavidyā* (pure knowledge). *Maya* is not presented as mere illusion, but rather as a potent power of the Lord in its hidden form. *Śuddhavidyā* is understood as the same power, but at a purified level, free from the veiling of ignorance.

> *"And the difference that Maya is there but not the individual Maya Maya is one of the uh Tattvas and when Maya Maya is not of just illusion Maya is the same power of the Lord in her hidden in the hidden But when the Maya gets transformed that is the the quantum leap in the Tattvas It is that from Maya to It has the same power the same energy which is Maya at the lower level becomes at the pure level and that means a pure wisdom pure knowledge etc But it is nothing but is two two parts of the same thing The Maya of the Lord is part and the should be the *Atma* is the the same power"* 

*   **The Triangular Relationship**: The author presents the interconnectedness of *Ātman*, *Paramātman* (Supreme Self), and *Maya* as a triangle, symbolizing their dynamic relationship. 

> *"And then he goes the because they are in a *Trikona* And you have both in the book and in my book the story of the manifestation of the *Trikona* which I have given with illustrations the relationship from *Atma Paramatma* and Maya Shiva Shakti and and It Shakti and the So this is what it describes Now this triangular which we find in the text In my book it is the relationship of the the "*

### **4. *Aham* and *Maha***

The discourse progresses to the concepts of *Aham* (I-consciousness) and *Maha* (the great, the universal), emphasizing the profound significance of *Aham* within the Trika system.

*   **The Importance of *Aham***:  The author underscores the central role of *Aham* in the text, highlighting its nature as the natural, innate mantra known as *Vāc*, representing the pure I-consciousness of the Divine. 

> *"Now he is He takes the question of the Devi as a as a Hindu would say *Bahana* as an excuse to elaborate on *Aham* and *Maha* because of *Maha Maha* In other words this uninterrupted power of consciousness indicated by a or manifestation of manifestation of the life in the form of the energy of the natural innate mantra known as the Vāc is *Ahaṁ*"*

*   **Utpaladeva's Verse**: To support this point, a frequently quoted verse by Utpaladeva from his *Ājñāpramātrasiddhi* (*Ajaḍapramātrasiddhi*) is introduced:

> * **takṣaś cit ātmā viśānte ahaṁ āvo iti ge getam** *

This verse emphasizes the unchanging state of repose inherent in the pure I-consciousness of light, which is likened to *ākāśa* (space).

*   **Challenges in Translation**: The author acknowledges the difficulty in translating *Aham* into Western languages due to its common association with the limited individual ego. In the Trika context, *Aham* signifies the universal consciousness that transcends individual limitations.

> *"So that is to to bring about this I this *Ahaṁ* that it is not an individual identity but it is that all-pervasive consciousness And that *viśānti* So if So that's why the translation into uh any Western language is so dangerous because they associate with I always the individual and here it is the universal light So this this makes a whole difficulty in translating and understanding because this *viśānti* You cannot get it in your limited uh ego uh which is full of the *saṁskāras* and *malas* and so on that there is no *viśānti* There is uh total restlessness But that *viśānti* you can only get it when you are in that supreme I-consciousness which is of the nature of light Light in the Supreme light across the So the *ākāśasya ātma viśānti ahaṁ āvo iti*"*

*   **The Nature of *Viśānti***: The text elucidates that true *viśānti* (repose) cannot be found within the realm of the limited, restless ego, but can only be achieved by merging with the supreme I-consciousness, which is inherently peaceful and free.

> *"And yeah I don't want to go into this philosophical discussion otherwise we cannot proceed with it with the text because how this *Aham* became so important in the system and not *Ātman* later in Vedānta But this is a very good discussion to relate *Ahaṁ* to the *viṣaya kārikā* in some other context"*

*   **The Real I-Feeling**: Expanding on the nature of this real I-consciousness, the author explains that it is characterized by a lack of attachment to external objects and a sense of repose in the uncontracted, unutterable aspect of experience. This is the true *Ahaṁ āva* – the experience of the self as pure, unbounded awareness.

> *"The real I feeling is that in which in the process of enjoyment all external objects lack the charm although they are intended to induce enjoyment from their manifoldness come to rest and finally repose in their essential uncontracted unutterable aspect And this unutterable aspect is the real *Ahaṁ āva*"* 

*   **Expansion of *Aham* and the Role of *Śakti***:  The text then explores the dynamic nature of *Aham*. In the process of expanding into manifestation, *Aham* takes on the form of *Ha*, symbolizing *Śakti* (power, energy). This expansion includes a dot (*bindu*), which represents both objective phenomena (*nara*) and the inherent unity of the entire expansion with the original *Aham*.

> *"Here in the process of expansion yesterday we have talked about A the not only the symbol of *Anuttara* but the beginning of the whole manifestation of language not only in Sanskrit but in so many other languages Here in the process of expansion it assume assumes the Ha form symbol of Śakti For expansion this other aspect of the form of Ha And this is a here it has a double meaning of the linguistic the uh expiration and of the emission So *Ahaṁ Ha* that is Kundalinī Śakti and then it expands into a dot symbolizing objective phenomena *nādo bindurūpaḥ na* and indicative of the identity of the entire expansion of Śakti with Haṁ"*

*   **Interpretation of *Ahaṁ Ha ma ahaṁ***: Abhinavagupta interprets the phrase *Ahaṁ Ha ma ahaṁ* as symbolic of the interplay of Śiva, Śakti, and *nāda* (sound). It represents the dynamic movement of consciousness as it expands into manifestation and then returns to its source. 

> *"So here he construes *Ahaṁ Ha ma ahaṁ* as representative of Śiva-Śakti-*nāda*"* 

### **5. Analysis of a Verse on *Aham***

The session continues with an analysis of a verse that evokes the concept of *Aham* through the multifaceted interpretation of the possessive pronoun "mine."

*   **The Verse and its Interpretation**: The verse is presented as follows:

> * **yaṁ na kiṁ canā mameti dīnānāṁ ātmā viśānti cara cara jantor bodhitaṁ satvabhū niśaṁ yaṁ na kiṁ canam ātmani sarvaṁ sarvaṁ iti mukhe put uttarāṁ tvaṁ upe upevā āha uttarāṁ tvaṁ upevā ātmā** *

This verse highlights the contrasting interpretations of the statement "nothing is mine" (*yaṁ na kiṁ canā mameti*). 

    * **For the unenlightened:** It signifies a state of lack and misery, leading to *dīnatā* (wretchedness). They experience *viśānti* (repose) only in the *ātman* (self) because they have not realized their true nature.
    * **For the enlightened:**  It signifies a state of fullness and freedom, where "nothing is mine" implies "I am everything" (*sarvaṁ sarvaṁ iti*). This realization leads to knowledge, happiness, and a sense of expansive unity with all of reality.

> *"It can be something possessive or just a juxtaposition. The thought nothing is mine makes insentient beings miserable. Couldn't put in the other form happily Nothing is mine makes insentient beings miserable. But the same thought nothing is mine means to me I am everything. That's why I have obtained the knowledge."*

*   **Psychological Perspective**: The author emphasizes that the same thought ("nothing is mine") can evoke drastically different psychological states – depression in one person and happiness in another – depending on their level of spiritual realization and their understanding of the true meaning of *Aham*.

> *"This is so beautiful that the same thing that's where and a a a maybe a psychologist can say also the same thing which causes depression in one person is a cause of happiness in another. Nothing is mine."*

*   **The Example of a *Sannyāsi***: To further illustrate this point, the author uses the example of a *Sannyāsi* (renunciate). A *Sannyāsi*, by definition, owns nothing material. Yet, they are often portrayed as being happy and free. This is because for them, the statement "nothing is mine" signifies a state of complete fullness and lack of desire for external possessions. Their happiness stems from their realization of their true nature as *Aham*. 

> *"It I mean, *Sannyāsi* or liberated being he doesn't own anything, but he is so happy. He's free. Nothing is mine. Because it means I am everything. But this is only when we come to that word "*

*   **Connection to *Śūnyatā***:  This concept is related to *Śūnyatā* (emptiness) in Buddhism. In Buddhism, *Śūnyatā* does not imply a nihilistic void but rather a fullness of potential – a state of freedom from clinging to fixed concepts and identities. Similarly, in the Trika context, "nothing is mine" points to the freedom inherent in recognizing oneself as the all-encompassing *Aham*, which is the source of all manifestation.

> *"It also relates very well to emptiness in Buddhism. *Śūnyatā*. The way it is translated. Uh, yes. Something I've to do. Uh Yeah. He he analyzes them on on a possessive pronoun. "*

### **6. Devi's Second Question and the Importance of the Heart**

The session progresses to Devi's second question, focusing on the **heart** as a central concept and symbol in the Parātrīśikā.

*   **Centrality of the Heart**:  The **heart** is presented as a crucial concept in the text, representing not just a physical organ, but also the vast space of consciousness, freedom, and the Divine.

> *"Now we come to the second part of the question of the Devi... Now here we come to it's difficult to see this central words because there are many central words in the text. But one which is really absolutely central is the **heart**."*

*   **The Heart in the Upaniṣads**:  The Upanisadic understanding of the **heart** is referenced. The Upanisads describe the *ākāśa* (space) within the **heart** as being as vast as the universe itself, containing all of creation within it. This vast inner space symbolizes the boundless nature of consciousness. Freedom, in this context, is understood as the ability to move freely within this expansive space of the **heart**.

> *"And why yesterday we were talking about *jñānīs* and *mokṣa* And we said this of the power moving into the space of consciousness It is really the power moving in the space of the **heart**. And that is why it causes the **heart** and this is right from Chāndogya Upaniṣad, the space of the **heart** is as vast as the universe. And the whole space is contained in it. And that freedom to move is freedom to move in the space of the **heart**."*

*   **Multiple Levels of Meaning**:  The author emphasizes that the **heart**, as a symbol, operates on multiple levels of meaning, ranging from the physical and anatomical to the mystical, spiritual, and universal. It encompasses the individual as well as the cosmic, representing a point of convergence between these realms.

> *"Now, in the In every Upaniṣad there's list of of occurrences of the their petiole forty in uh different different levels of meaning. Uh, and **heart** that's why **heart** is one of the consequences in for because it comprises from the physical to the mystical and to the universal from individual to the universal. That comprises all these levels."*

*   **The Heart in the Tantras**: The author highlights that while the Parātrīśikā is firmly rooted in the Tantric tradition, it places significant emphasis on the concept of the **heart**, going beyond the specific Tantric practices to emphasize the vastness, inclusiveness, and transformative potential of the **heart**.

> *"And even from the tantra itself sometimes uh in in Abhinavagupta has uh added something or has expanded something which is not so much in the tantric text. But here it is definitely faithful to the tantric background. It gives so much importance to the **heart**"*

*   **Devi's Second Verse**: Devi's second verse is then presented, directing the focus towards *Kauliki-kulanāyikā*, the *śakti* residing in the heart:

> * **Hṛdaya- sthā tu yā śaktiḥ Kauliki-kulanāyikā tāṃ me kathaya devesha yena tṛptim labhāmyaham** *

*   **Focus on *Kauliki-kulanāyikā***: This verse introduces the central focus of the following discussion: *Kauliki-kulanāyikā*. She is described as the *śakti* (power, energy) dwelling within the heart, who is both the origin and the presiding deity of all manifestation.

*   **Devi's Aim - *Tṛpti***: The author emphasizes that despite her advanced knowledge, Devi requests Parameśvara to reveal the nature of *Kauliki-kulanāyikā* so that she may attain *tṛpti* (full satisfaction, fulfillment). This suggests that mere intellectual understanding is insufficient; true fulfillment requires direct experience and realization of this *śakti*.

> *"Now here we come to *Kauliki-kulanāyikā*. That clearly shows that she already knows. She knows part Still she requests him to reveal this to her *Kauliki kula nayika*. Why? *yena tṛptim labhāmyaham*. By which I obtain full satisfaction."*

### **7. Commentary on Devi's Second Question**

The author provides a detailed commentary on Devi's second question, exploring the various facets of *Kauliki-kulanāyikā* and her relationship to the heart, the universe, and the aspirant.

*   **Analysis of *Vitjastā kukṣitā se ah***:  The author analyzes the Sanskrit phrase *Vitjastā kukṣitā se ah*, which describes the nature of the **heart** (*hṛdaya*). 

    * *Vitjastā*: Refers to the supreme conscious base of all experiences, both objective and subjective.
    * *kukṣitā*:  Refers to the knowledge of manifold objects, brought about by the freedom of consciousness.
    * *se ah*: Refers to the scintillating *śakti* abiding within this knowledge.

> *"Now Yeah. This commentary then 161. *Vitjastā kukṣitā se ah*, the *vacanā* analysis splitting the word with *ātmā sparśāt* is the Supreme conscious base of all objective experiences, like blue, et cetera. And subjective experiences, like pleasure, et cetera...  *Ātmā* means knowledge of manifold varied objects, like jar, cloth, et cetera. Brought about by its own freedom. *Sparśāt* means the scintillating *śakti*, abiding in the So, *Vitjastā* means the scintillating energy abiding in the knowledge of varied objects, brought about by the Supreme conscious base of all objective and subjective experience and experience by its own freedom."* 

The author clarifies that the **heart** encompasses both the vastness of *Viśvanātha* (the Lord of the Universe) and the limitations of individual experience conditioned by the body, *prāṇa* (life force), and senses. 

*   **Interpretation of *kulanāyakā***: The term *kulanāyakā* is interpreted as referring to Śiva in his role as the leader of all the *śaktis* and the controller of the universe. The universe is understood as a manifestation of *śakti*, and therefore, Śiva is the *nāyaka* (leader) of *Kula*. *Kulan* is used here in its most inclusive sense, encompassing all levels of existence.

> *"Then he interprets *kulanāyakā*. So, Śiva is the leader of all the *śaktis*, also the leader of the whole universal controlling it, which actually because the whole universe is nothing but manifestation of *śakti*. So, *kulan* in that inclusive sense, including the body, *prāṇa* and the *indriya*, et cetera."*

*   **Understanding *Kaulikī***: *Kaulikī* is defined as the *śakti* that immanentizes, that manifests the entirety of *Kula*. It represents the expansive power of the Divine as it takes form in the universe, encompassing all aspects of existence.

> *" *Kaulikī* This one... *Guru* to immanentize all manifestation is precisely what *Kula* The vastness of *kulanāyakaulikī*. Precisely what the *Kula* "*

*   **The Union of *Akula* and *Kula***: The author emphasizes that Śiva is both *Akula* (beyond *Kula*) and *Kula* simultaneously. He transcends manifestation, yet is also the source and the essence of all that is manifest. 

> *"*Akula apara deīnāyakī* and *Kula* is Śiva and *Kulaśakti Kaulikī*. So, The union of *Akula* and *Kula*. For one who abides in *Kula*, but is *Akula* is *Kaula*. That is Śiva. Being who is *Kaula* or Śiva abides in identical form as *Kaulikī*. "*

*   **Quotation from Spanda Kārikā**: A verse from Spanda Kārikā is quoted, highlighting the role of *ātmā sparśāt* (touch of the power of the self) in spiritual realization. This verse emphasizes the power of Śiva, who, through his *śaktis*, empowers the aspirant to realize their true nature. The interconnectedness of the individual with the universal is underscored, as the *spanda* (vibration) of the Self empowers even the senses to function.

> *"And therefore, the quotes Spanda Kārikā, is very beautiful. A bit of art about this verse and I don't have the text here. But those of you who have studied Spanda Kārikā can remember that it's only by by a touch of the power of the self, *ātmā sparśāt* by coming in contact with the power of the self that the realization occurs. *Ātmā sparśāt*. *Tathā deīnāthīśvara* resorting to that power, that divinity is manifested together with the secret formula. That is, the indicators being endowed with the power of omniscience, proceed to carry out their assigned functions towards their embodied forms, just as the senses of their embodied forms are resorting to the power of *spanda*, proceed to carry out their specific functions."* 

*   **Variant Readings**: Abhinavagupta acknowledges the existence of variant readings in the text, demonstrating his awareness of the diverse interpretations within the tradition. He mentions Somananda's interpretation, which understands *tṛpti* (satisfaction) as the enjoyment of the bliss of the highest *Anuttara*. He also mentions Jayaratha's reading of *brajāmi* (I go) instead of *labhāmi*. Abhinavagupta, however, adopts the reading *labhāmi* in his commentary.

> *"And then there is a *śloka śīghreśas*, Lord of Lords, oh Lord of the Gods, *śīghreśa*. The force at this. Mm, *śīghreśa*. Pleasure, Lord of Lords, and *śīghreśa*, et cetera... This is interesting because, uh, of the consciousness, this is for scholars. The consciousness that these authors have of various varied versions...  There is also another reading by Jayaratha instead of *labhāmi*. So, there are several variants that Abhinavagupta was fully conscious that there are variants in the text itself. And Abhinavagupta adopted this reading, *labhāmi*. The different, uh, versions."*

*   **The Universal Nature of *Pāśa***: The author clarifies that the term *Pāśa* (bondage) is not used here to refer to individual, limited energy but to the all-encompassing life force that binds the universe together. This points to the non-dualistic understanding where even bondage is ultimately an expression of the Divine.

> *"By the word *aham, labhāmi, aham*, this should be understood, the life and soul of worldly experience. So, this is very clear from this verse. He says, "This *Pāśa* is the universal life, and not the energy in its individual."*

*   **Complete I-Consciousness and Satisfaction**:  The ultimate aim of the teaching on *Kaulikī* is presented as the attainment of complete I-consciousness, which leads to ultimate satisfaction (*tṛpti*). This state is characterized by a recognition of oneself as the Divine – the source of all *viśva śakti* (universal power) and the ground of all existence.

> *"Having understood that the teaching, the nature of highest described contains the satisfaction of knowing oneself as the divine, the satisfaction of complete i-consciousness. And this is the only way where this *viśva śakti* or this, where you can rest."*

### **8. Concluding Remarks**

The session concludes by bringing together the key concepts discussed – *sphūrti* (inspiration), the **heart**, *Uvāca* (said), and the name of Bhairava.

*   **Recap of Key Concepts**:  The author revisits the concept of *sphūrti* (inspiration), which is understood as a yearning for Śiva *rasa* (the essence of Śiva). It is this longing for the Divine that propels the aspirant towards realization.  Śiva *rasa* is described as having the power to destroy all that is inauspicious and to dissolve the knot of ignorance that binds the **heart**, allowing the freedom of *chit* (consciousness) to move unhindered within the vast space of the **heart**.

> *"And, now, finally, after the lady has asked a question to him and author says, "Finally, *Haivara*." *Haivara, vacanāt*. Of course But, I still would like to remind you of those words because it's so beautiful. That those are because the word *sphūrti*, she connects with those who are thirsting for the Śivā *rasa*. Śivā *rasa Sparśam īśānti pāśa*, the *mānasam satatam aśivatvaṃ śaktaṃ śivena niścitam. Vitjā yatra bhavati diśte śān vidhārayed, yathā trika teśu, taṃ*. So, I think you remember... Those who are thirsting for this Śivā *rasa*. And that Śivā *rasa* is gated, it destroys all *aśiva*, all inauspiciousness, all And to dissolving the knot, which is in the life in the space of the **heart**."*

*   **Significance of *Uvāca***: The author explains that *Uvāca* (said) does not simply signify the past tense or a third-person narrative. It is used to bring the teachings from the past into the present, making them relevant and applicable to the current context. The dialogue between Devi and Bhairava is not a historical event, but an ongoing conversation happening within the **heart** of the aspirant.

> *"And we have already discussed it. That first three *hṛdaya vacanāt*, which when do in the sense that. And he says for the benefit of *Uvāca*, what he has explained in the days of the lady, applies also here. *Uvāca* might not only means past, nor does it mean the third person. Somebody else is called pradhava or somebody is called something. But it is not you who alone pray the Lord. And the pastness is also, uh, brought to the present. So, the past and the past tense is here so that he brings them."*

*   **Analysis of Pradhava's Name**:  The author briefly touches upon the analysis of Bhairava's name (*bhairava*, *pradhava*), acknowledging the existence of extensive interpretations but choosing not to elaborate on them in detail at this point.

> *"So, *prati vacanāt* of pradhava, but this is the analysis of the name. I don't want There's so many, uh, pages and pages of all the analysis of ah, different interpretations of the name. And if one is to go on, then they might require at least 16 pages of the book only on the name pradhava. From different sources. So, this is only one "*

The session concludes with a reiteration of the fundamental teaching of the Parātrīśikā – that the *kauliki vidhi* (the order of totality) is ultimately an expression of *Anuttara*, the Unsurpassable, and that *kauliki siddhi* (the perfection of totality) is achieved through the realization of the true Self, which is non-different from the Divine.
