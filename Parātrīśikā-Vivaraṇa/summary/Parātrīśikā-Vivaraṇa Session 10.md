## Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa Session 10: Summary and Retelling

This document provides a detailed summary and retelling of the 10th session of the Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa, focusing on the concluding verses of Chapter 3. The session centers around the commentary of Abhinavagupta on the Parātrīśikā Tantra, a foundational text of Kashmir Shaivism,  revealing the esoteric dimensions of ritual practice and the transformative power of knowledge in attaining liberation. 

### 1. Introduction and Scope

The session aims to offer a concise overview of the concluding verses of Chapter 3, focusing on the essence of the teachings while acknowledging the limited time available. Due to these constraints, certain sections of the text are omitted:

* **Omissions:**
    *  A significant portion dedicated to the exploration of _mantras_ and their relationship to the elements of language and *tattvas*.
    *  The full revelation of the specific _mantra_ known as _hṛdayabīja_, the "seed of the heart".  

Despite these omissions, the speaker clarifies that the _hṛdayabīja_ mantra, although esoteric, is inherently accessible to all.  Its detailed decoding, however, requires more time and is reserved for future sessions.

* **Focus:**
    *  The final verses of Chapter 3, specifically verses 31-37, which describe the _pūjā_ (worship) and its deeper, esoteric interpretation.
    *   Emphasis on the transformative state of awareness that the _yogī_ cultivates during the ritual practice.

### 2. Worship and Knowledge: Transcending Duality

The session begins by highlighting the nature of worship within the non-dualistic framework of Kashmir Shaivism. It contrasts this understanding with ritualistic practices in other traditions, revealing the unique emphasis on inner transformation and the transcendence of duality between knowledge and action.

* **Worship in Tantrism:**
    > *"Worship in Tantrism is considered to be the offering of all things in non-differentiated unity."*

This statement sets the stage for understanding the deeper significance of ritual practice. In Kashmir Shaivism, worship is not merely an external act of propitiation but an embodiment of the underlying non-dual consciousness.

* **Goal of Practices:**
    > "*The state of perfect fullness which is obtained by worship, recitation, meditation, sacrifice, vows, and other practices, all these things, regardless whatever we are doing, is called absorption *samādhi* by the ancient masters."*

The ultimate aim of all practices, whether ritualistic or contemplative, is to attain the state of *samādhi*, characterized by complete absorption in the Supreme Reality. This state signifies the transcendence of the limitations of individual consciousness and the realization of oneness with the Divine.

* **Triśūla Śritrika Sūtra and Ritual Knowledge:**
    > "*It is said in the *triśūla śritrika sūtra*... such as the one who does not know the ritual prescription he becomes a knower of sacrifice."*

The speaker quotes from the _triśūla śritrika sūtra_ (also known as _Parātrīśikā_), emphasizing that even without a detailed understanding of external rituals, one can attain the state of a "knower of sacrifice". This implies that true knowledge transcends the limitations of ritual prescriptions and leads to a deeper understanding of the sacrificial act.

* **Meaning of "Knower of Sacrifice":**
    > "*Vihe vihāra padika vihe vi vihāranam atha rūpaśūraṇam*. So actually...He who knows the rules regarding uh sacrifice or regarding rituals."*

The Sanskrit phrase clarifies that the "knower of sacrifice" is not simply one who mechanically performs rituals, but one who has penetrated the deeper meaning and significance of the sacrificial act. This understanding is rooted in the non-dual consciousness and transcends the limitations of mere external observance.

### 3. Transcending External Rituals:  The Primacy of *Jñana* (Knowledge)

The session then delves into the idea of transcending external rituals through knowledge, highlighting the Parātrīśikā's unique approach in emphasizing internal transformation over outward actions.

* **Triśikhā Tantra and Vijñanabhairava:**
    * The speaker draws a comparison between the _Triśikhā Tantra_ and the _Vijñanabhairava_, noting that the _Triśikhā Tantra_ is more focused on external rituals, whereas the _Vijñanabhairava_ emphasizes meditation and internal practices.
* **Unnecessity of External Rituals:**
    > "*Maṇḍala upēvāṃ yaḥ paścitvēti tantuvatā sa siddhibhāg bhavetkiyaṃ sāyujyam asau vrajet.*" -  Even without seeing the *maṇḍala*, one can attain perfection through knowledge.

This verse from the _Parātrīśikā_ underscores the text's central message that true knowledge, or *jñāna*, is sufficient for attaining liberation and transcends the need for elaborate external rituals. The *maṇḍala*, an essential element in traditional Tantric initiation, is used here to symbolize the entire framework of external practices.

* **Interpretations of *Maṇḍala***:
    * The *maṇḍala* can be understood on multiple levels. Primarily, it represents the background or context of the ritual, particularly the _triśūlārdhamaṇḍalam_ (trident diagram) symbolizing the three fundamental energies: _parā_ (supreme), _parāparā_ (supreme-non-supreme), and _aparā_ (non-supreme). 
    * Another interpretation relates the *maṇḍala* to the yogic body, with its network of _nāḍīs_ (energy channels) and _chakras_ (energy centers). This suggests that the *maṇḍala* can also be understood as an internal landscape within the subtle body of the practitioner.
* **Knowledge Transcends Ritual:**
    > "*Anyena jñāta mātrēṇa triśaktibhiḥ.*" - By mere knowledge, one is known by all the *śaktis* (powers).

This half-verse further emphasizes the supremacy of _jñāna_. It states that through the realization of the true nature of the Self, the *yogī* is recognized by the divine *śaktis* (powers) themselves. This recognition signifies the attainment of spiritual perfection and liberation.

* **Passive Reception of Knowledge:**
    * This verse highlights a crucial shift in perspective.  Instead of the *yogī* actively seeking knowledge or striving for liberation, he becomes the *object* of knowledge and is recognized by the divine powers. This emphasizes the grace-filled nature of enlightenment in Kashmir Shaivism, where the Supreme Reality reveals itself to the *yogī* who has attained the necessary level of inner purification and understanding.
* **Removal of Affliction through Union with *Śaktis***:
    > "*Śakti-nicaya-samāyoga-vaśāt rogah vinaśyati.*" - Union with the *śaktis* leads to the eradication of suffering.

The union with the *śaktis* signifies a state of non-dual awareness, where the limitations of the individual self are dissolved in the ocean of divine consciousness. This union results in the removal of _roga_ (suffering or affliction), indicating the liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

### 4. The Heart and the Universe: A Symbolic Microcosm

The session then moves towards the symbol of the *heart*, highlighting its multi-layered meaning within the _Parātrīśikā_ and exploring its significance as a microcosm containing the entire universe.

* **The Dynamic Heart:**
    > "*Tadāntar-vartīyat kiñcit śuddhātmā vyavasthitam. Antaḥ-viśuddham acintya-tattva-jñānam aśnute.*" -  Whatever exists resides within the pure heart, where the individual attains divine knowledge.

This verse underscores the expansive nature of the *heart*. It states that all things reside within the pure, divine heart and that it is through this inner heart that the individual (*aṇu*) attains the supreme, unimaginable knowledge of the *tattvas*.

* **The *Mantra* and the Heart:**
    * The *heart* is used here as a symbol for both the *mantra* and the universe. It is not merely a physical organ but represents the *locus* of the divine consciousness.
    * The speaker clarifies that the *heart* contains the dynamic principle of creation, symbolized by *prakṛti* transformed into *parā-prakṛti*. This signifies the dynamic interplay of *śiva* and *śakti* within the heart, giving rise to the entire cosmos.
* **Difference from Chandogya Upanishad:**
    * The speaker draws a distinction between the *tantric* understanding of the *heart* and the meditation on the heart as presented in the _Chandogya Upanishad_. 
    * While the Upanishadic meditation primarily focuses on the realization of the cosmos within the *heart*, the _tantric_ conception emphasizes the dynamism and transformative power inherent within the *heart*, where the divine energies of *śiva* and *śakti* continuously interplay.
* **Initiation through Knowledge:**
    > "*Nirvana dīkṣā*" -  The conviction of knowledge itself is an initiation for liberation.

The realization of the truth contained within the *heart* leads to *nirvāṇa dīkṣā*,  meaning that the very conviction of knowledge itself acts as a potent form of initiation. This emphasizes the power of *jñāna* as the direct path to liberation, bypassing the need for elaborate external rituals.

### 5. Ritual and Non-Dualism: A Transformative Union

Continuing the discussion on the interplay of ritual and knowledge, the session focuses on the non-dualistic interpretation of the ritual acts, revealing how they symbolize the union of *śiva* and *śakti* within the *yogī*.

* **Worship with Supreme Devotion:**
    > "*Asmad-rūpa-saṃsthā svātmānam sthāpaya śivākarottu nijayā namaḥ śaktyā tat tvam asi*" - Establish yourself in our form, let Śiva make you his own through his power, you are that.

The speaker quotes a mantra that encapsulates the essence of non-dualistic worship. It emphasizes the surrender of the individual self to the divine form (*asmad-rūpa*), ultimately leading to the realization of oneness with *śiva* through his power (*śakti*).  The concluding phrase, "_tat tvam asi_" ("You are That"), reinforces this realization of non-duality.

* **Non-touristic *Prakṛti***:
    * The speaker introduces the concept of *parā-prakṛti*, which represents a non-dualistic understanding of *prakṛti* (the dynamic principle of creation). This contrasts with the ordinary understanding of *prakṛti* as something separate from the Self, based on *abheda* (absence consciousness).
    *  *Parā-prakṛti*, however, signifies *prakṛti* as an expression of the divine consciousness, inseparable from the ultimate Reality. This understanding aligns with the core teachings of Kashmir Shaivism, where the entire cosmos is seen as a manifestation of *śiva* and *śakti*.
* **Offering Oneself:**
    *  The speaker emphasizes that the ultimate offering in worship is not any external object but the offering of oneself to the Divine. This symbolizes the complete surrender of the individual ego and the merging of the limited self with the universal consciousness.
* **Enclosure of *Sṛṣṭi***:
    > "*Sṛṣṭiṃ tu saṃputikṛtya paścāt*" - Enclosing the ritual of creation using *saṃputikaraṇa* (enclosing a *mantra* with another *mantra* for increased potency).

This verse refers to the practice of *saṃputikaraṇa*, a ritual technique where a *mantra* is enclosed within another *mantra* to enhance its potency. This act is interpreted here as symbolizing the merging of the individual consciousness with the divine power, leading to a heightened state of spiritual awareness. 

* **Worship of Maheśānī:**
    > "*Sarva-tattvaiḥ susampūrṇam sarvābharaṇa-bhūṣitām yacaitad devī maheśāni sapta-viṃśati- anvitām*" - Worship the goddess Maheśānī, who is complete with all *tattvas* and adorned with ornaments, consecrated with 27 *mantras*.

This verse describes the worship of the Goddess Maheśānī, who represents the supreme *śakti*. Her completeness with all *tattvas* and her adornment with ornaments signify her all-encompassing nature and her dominion over the entire cosmos.

### 6. Remembering the Guru and the *Mantra*: Internalization of the Ritual

The session then turns towards the internalization of the ritual, highlighting the importance of *smaraṇa* (remembrance) in connecting to the power of the *mantra* and the grace of the *guru*.

* **Remembering the Seed and the Teacher:**
    > "*Catur- kṛta-pūjā-vidhi-samyak- smaraṇīyaṃ tu sadbhiḥ*" -  The performance of the ritual involves perfectly remembering the seed (*mantra*) and the teacher (inner teacher or the *mantra* itself).

This verse emphasizes the importance of *smaraṇa*, which is more than mere intellectual recollection. It signifies a deep, meditative awareness of the *mantra* and a connection to the inner *guru* (teacher).

* **Meditation on the Inner Teacher:**
    > "The mentally very much uh because it's a kind of meditation uh just about the inner teacher that that performs the worship in a proper manner that he listens to his guru that is that is happy is gentle obedient"

The speaker reiterates that the ritual practice involves meditating on the inner *guru*. This inner *guru* can be understood as the awakened consciousness within, guiding the *yogī* towards liberation.

### 7. The Supreme God and the Heart: The Locus of Unity

The session culminates with verses that poetically describe the Supreme Reality and the Heart as the locus of unity and the source of omniscience.

* **Unique Resplendence:**
    > "That in which the entire universe shines and which shines everywhere that is the one of unique resplendence, which is the supreme God."

This verse encapsulates the all-pervasive nature of the Supreme Reality, shining forth in the entire cosmos. It emphasizes the immanence of the Divine, present in every aspect of creation.

* **Expanding and Contracting Heart:**
    * The speaker evokes a beautiful metaphor, comparing the *heart* to a jewel or a mirror that expands and contracts, symbolizing the dynamic nature of consciousness.  This dynamism encompasses both the manifestation of the universe (*sṛṣṭi*) and its reabsorption (*saṃhāra*).
* **Omniscience as Luminous Perception:**
    > "*Iti sarvatvaṃ na samaśreyaḥ yoga etats te iti atiśayena vadatā ātmā tatra aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ yat yac chatām iti sarvājñatvam*" - Omniscience becomes a direct luminous perception through the fulfillment of desires, transcending discriminations.

The verse describes the attainment of *sarvājñatvam* (omniscience), not as an intellectual accumulation of knowledge, but as a direct, luminous perception. This state arises from the fulfillment of all desires, transcending the limitations of dualistic perception and culminating in the realization of unity consciousness. 

### 8. Attainment of the Transcendental State: Merging with *Akula Sattā* (Absolute Reality)

The session then turns towards the ultimate goal of the *yogī*: the attainment of the transcendental state of liberation.

* **Concluding the Book:**
    > "After examining from all points of view, the book is now being concluded."

This statement marks the culmination of the commentary on Chapter 3, leading towards the concluding verses of the _Parātrīśikā_.

* **Resting in the Essential Self:**
    > "In the end, the progress of the *yogī* terminates in the attainment of his transcendental state *akula-sattā* or *asamprajñata*, which means resting in one's essential self. This alone is the state of liberation."

The verse describes the state of liberation as *akula-sattā* or *asamprajñata*, signifying the Absolute Reality beyond all mental constructs. It emphasizes the *yogī's* complete immersion in the pure, undifferentiated consciousness, transcending the limitations of the individual self.

* **Final Bliss of the *Puruṣa***:
    > "*Viśrānti-rūpa akula-sattā asamprajñata*. This is the state which the *yogī* acquires...The attainment of the absolute or transcendental state of the nature of the *puruṣa*."

The Sanskrit phrase highlights the blissful nature of this transcendental state, characterizing it as *viśrānti*, meaning "repose" or "rest". This signifies the perfect peace and contentment experienced by the *puruṣa* (Self) upon realizing its true nature.

* **Union of *Śiva* and *Śakti***:
    > "*Mantra-tantra-prayoga-tantra etad apy āsaṃsiddhi-sāvadyatvam āvadyatvam āvadyatvam*. Such is the gain from the practice of this *mantra*. This betokens the union of *mantra* and *mantra*, that is of *śiva* and *śakti*. By the continuous practice of this is acquired the supernatural power of omniscience."

This verse, the penultimate verse of the _Parātrīśikā_, reiterates the significance of the *mantra* as a tool for realizing the union of *śiva* and *śakti*. This union, however, is not an external event but an internal realization that takes place within the *yogī*.

* **Realization of Union:**
    * The speaker emphasizes that the union of *śiva* and *śakti*, represented by the *mantra*, must be realized within the consciousness of the *yogī*. This signifies the merging of the individual consciousness with the universal consciousness, transcending all duality.
* **Awareness of the Essential Self:**
    > "In conclusion, we said that this connotes the union of *mantra* and *mantra*, that is of *śiva* and *śakti*, where there is no division of question and answer, which is the state of awareness of the essential self, *svarūpa* consciousness."

This statement, referring to the final verse of the _Parātrīśikā_, reveals the culmination of the *tantric* path: the realization of the non-dual awareness of the essential Self (*svarūpa*).  This state transcends the limitations of language and thought, as symbolized by the absence of question and answer.

### 9. Conclusion

The session concludes with autobiographical verses composed by Abhinavagupta, offering a glimpse into his lineage, his devotion to his gurus, and his deep affection for his disciples. These verses emphasize the importance of spiritual guidance, the transmission of knowledge within the lineage, and the ultimate goal of liberation through the realization of the non-dual consciousness. 

The session leaves the listeners with a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of ritual and knowledge within Kashmir Shaivism.  While the external rituals serve as a support for focusing the mind and invoking the divine energies, it is the inner transformation through knowledge (*jñāna*) and the realization of the non-dual consciousness that leads to the ultimate liberation of the Self.
