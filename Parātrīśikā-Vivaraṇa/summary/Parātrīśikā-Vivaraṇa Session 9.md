## Abhinavagupta's Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa: Session 9 - Unveiling the Heart of Reality

This session of the Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa delves deep into the core concepts of Trika philosophy, focusing on the relationship between *anuttara* (the Unsurpassable) and *uttara* (the surpassed), the significance of the heart as the locus of reality, the transformative power of *saṃjñāna* (intuitive gnosis), and the interplay of grace (*śaktipāta*) and spiritual practice in attaining liberation. 

### Entering the Sacred Space: Benediction and Invocation

The session commences with a recitation of Sanskrit verses, invoking the blessings of the divine and setting the stage for the profound teachings to follow.

**Vimatalāśrayā viśva-sṛṣṭi-mahājananī** 
**Bharitatnuśca pañcamukha-kṛta-ruci-janakāḥ**
**Tadupāyayā malaṃ sphuṭitvā viśvargam ayam**
**Hṛdayaṃ antarārāṃṛta-kūlaṃ mama saṃspṛśāt**

These verses, attributed to Abhinavagupta, encapsulate the essence of Trika philosophy, invoking the divine Mother (*jananī*) and Father (*janakāḥ*) as the source of creation (*viśva-sṛṣṭi*). They highlight the process of purification (*malaṃ sphuṭitvā*) leading to the flourishing of the heart (*hṛdayaṃ saṃspṛśāt*), which is the abode of the ultimate nectar (*antarārāṃṛta-kūlaṃ*). 

Following this, the opening verses of the *Parātrīśikā* are chanted, presenting the Devi's question and Bhairava's initial response:

**Śrī Devī-vākyam**
**Anuttarāṃ gatham devāṃ satya-kautīka-siddham**
**Enāṃ vijñāta-mātrāṃ khedinī samatāṃ vrajet**
**Etadguriyam mahāguriyam kareyasvāṃ mahāprabhoḥ**
**Hṛdayasthā-dvitīyā-śaktiḥ kautīka-kula-nāyikā**
**Tāṃ ekā kathya deveśo yena triptiṃ labhāmyaham**

**Śrī Bhairava-vākyam**
**Śrīṃ Devī mahā-bhaye uttarasya-pyanuttarāṃ**
**Kautīkuyam vividhevi mahad-bhāvanya vasthitāḥ**
**Kareyāmi sureśāni satya-kautīka-siddham**
**Athā**

The Devi's question seeks to understand how *anuttara*, the Unsurpassable, bestows the perfection of totality (*kautīka-siddham*) and how mere knowledge of it leads to unity with the universal Consciousness (*khedinī samatāṃ vrajet*). Bhairava, addressing the Devi as "mahā-bhaye" (the one who removes great fear), promises to reveal the truth about *uttara* and *anuttara*.

### *Saṃjñāna*: The Key to Unveiling Reality

The session emphasizes the significance of *saṃjñāna*, intuitive gnosis, as the primary means of realizing the truth revealed in the *Parātrīśikā*. Unlike the traditional emphasis on rituals and yogic practices, Abhinavagupta highlights the direct and immediate nature of this intuitive insight. He elucidates that *saṃjñāna* is accessible to all, unrestricted by initiation or caste, underscoring the universal nature of this knowledge.

The term **prasaṃjñāna** is introduced as a potent key, signifying a deeper and more profound intuitive understanding that arises from the grace of the Divine. It's a state of awareness where the veil of ignorance is lifted, revealing the true nature of reality. 

### Unveiling the Mysteries of *Uttara* and *Anuttara*

The session delves into the intricate relationship between *uttara* (the surpassed) and *anuttara* (the Unsurpassable), particularly in the context of Bhairava's response: "_Uttarasya-pyanuttaram_". This statement, a concise *sūtra* containing multiple layers of meaning, forms the crux of the discussion.

#### The Paradox of No Answer

Abhinavagupta first presents the interpretation that even the second part of the text, dealing with *uttara*, doesn't provide a definitive answer to the Devi's question. This seemingly paradoxical statement underscores the limitations of language and conceptual understanding in grasping the Absolute. 

#### Exploring the Multifaceted *Uttara*

Abhinavagupta then explores various meanings of *uttara*, ranging from "more" or "additional" to its association with the phenomenal world and its activities. He establishes a hierarchy of systems, placing *Trika* at the highest level, followed by *Matta*, *Kaula*, and other doctrines.

#### Integrating the Supreme into the Relative

A crucial verse from *Samvitprakāśa* (23) is analyzed:

> *param vyavasthāpi pare yāvat nātmī kṛta parā tāvat na śakyate kartuṃ yato bhukta paraṃ pare*

This verse highlights the importance of integrating the Supreme Reality (*parā*) into oneself (*ātmī kṛta parā*) for comprehending even the relative (*para vyavasthāpi pare*). The relative, including all phenomena and experiences, must be understood in the light of the Absolute. Only by assimilating the Absolute into one's being can the true nature of the relative be discerned.

### *Anuttara*: The Wellspring of Manifestation

The session elaborates on the concept of *anuttara* as the source of *mahasrishti*, the great manifestation. This *mahasrishti* encompasses countless undifferentiated phenomena (*māyā prakṛtis*) and all aspects of sensory experience, including pleasure, pain, the senses, and objects of perception. It represents the totality of existence, emanating from and resting within the Absolute divine Consciousness.

#### *Yatassarvam*: From Which Everything Proceeds

The discussion emphasizes the interconnectedness of everything with *anuttara*, the source, based on the principle of *yatassarvam* (from which everything proceeds). The *mahasrishti*, the great emanation, encompasses all cycles of creation, dissolution, and recreation, highlighting the dynamic nature of reality.

#### *Yasmin sarvam*: In Which All Things Exist

The locative aspect, *yasmin sarvam* (in which all things exist), is then examined. The universe, encompassing 36 *tattvas* (principles of reality), rests in Consciousness itself. The concepts of *samānya-spanda* (universal vibration) and *viśeṣa-spanda* (particular creative pulsation) are introduced to explain how the universal Consciousness manifests in diverse forms.

#### The Grammatical Tapestry of Reality

Abhinavagupta emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between *uttara* and *anuttara* through the lens of Sanskrit grammar. All grammatical cases, including locative, ablative, instrumental, nominative, and genitive, are relevant in expressing the intricate connection between the relative and the Absolute. He demonstrates how *anuttara*, the Unsurpassable, pervades and encompasses all aspects of *uttara*, the surpassed.

### The Hierarchy of Systems and the Universal *Anuttara*

The session delves into the hierarchy of systems and traditions, elucidating that while different paths exist, *anuttara* represents the ultimate truth, the common ground underlying all systems.

#### The Descending Order of Truth

Abhinavagupta presents a hierarchical order of systems, starting with *Trika* as the highest revelation, followed by:

* *Matta*
* *Kaula*
* Right-hand doctrine
* Left-hand doctrine
* Shaiva
* Vaishnava

This hierarchy reflects a progression from non-dualistic to dualistic perspectives, with *Trika* encompassing and validating all other systems.

#### *Svabhāva-man-manaḥ*: The Essential Nature

The concept of *svabhāva-man-manaḥ* is introduced, highlighting *anuttara* as the *svabhāva* (essential nature) that permeates everything. This essential nature is the ultimate reality, the ground of being that sustains all phenomena and experiences.

#### *Saṃsāra-chakra*: The Cycle of Existence

This understanding leads to the concept of *saṃsāra-chakra* (the cycle of existence), with Śiva or *anuttara* as the all-pervasive entity. Despite the apparent differences and multiplicity in the world, everything is interconnected and rooted in the *anuttara*.

#### Abhinavagupta's Direct Approach

The session acknowledges Abhinavagupta's distinct style, characterized by directness and conciseness, contrasting with the more elaborate explanations found in other commentaries. This direct approach reflects the immediacy of intuitive gnosis, aiming to cut through conceptual complexities and reveal the essence of truth.

### The Tautological Truth of *Anuttara*

Abhinavagupta concludes this section of the commentary with a seemingly tautological statement:

> **Everything is *anuttara* because of being *anuttara* (*anuttaratvāt*).**

This statement, though appearing circular, underscores the all-encompassing nature of *anuttara*. It signifies that everything is ultimately the Absolute, regardless of its apparent form or characteristics. There is no separation between the relative and the Absolute; everything is ultimately *anuttara*.

### The Heart: The Seat of Reality

The discussion then shifts focus to the concept of the **heart**, a central symbol in Trika philosophy. Abhinavagupta defines it as the locus, foundation, and abode of all existing things, emphasizing its significance as the seat of reality.

#### The Heart as Pratiṣṭhā-kāma

The **heart** is described as *pratiṣṭhā-kāma*, the foundational luminous abode of all things and states. It encompasses all aspects of reality, from external objects to internal experiences, emotions, and the sense of self. The understanding of reality is contingent upon the level of consciousness associated with the **heart*.

#### The Heart and the Divine Feminine

Abhinavagupta elucidates the connection between the **heart** and the supreme goddess, stating:

> "That you will be in the space of my **heart**. This the locus, the foundation, the functioning, the abode of all existing things."

This statement reveals the **heart** as the abode of the Divine Feminine, the creative energy (*śakti*) that manifests the universe. 

#### The Heart as the Womb of Potential

The universe is then described as a reflection in the Lord's consciousness, arising from the supreme goddess's creative power, *śakti*. This power of universality is called *icchāśakti*, the energy of will.  The **heart** is the essence of the goddess, representing the womb state of absolute potential (*visarga*) from which all manifestation arises.

### The Heart in Utpaladeva's *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā*

The session explores the concept of the **heart** as presented in Utpaladeva's *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā* (chapter 20), highlighting its multifaceted nature.

#### The Heart as Luminous Vibration

The **heart** is described as:

* The supreme warmth arising freely.
* The luminous, vibrating support of the absolute being (*mahasattā*), unmodified by space and time.
* The essence of the Supreme Lord.

These descriptions emphasize the dynamic and vibrant nature of the **heart**, its pulsating energy that sustains and animates all reality.

#### The Heart as Spanda and Spandana

The **heart** is characterized by *spanda* and *spandana*, terms denoting the subtle vibrations of consciousness. These vibrations are the fundamental dynamism of reality, the source of all manifestation and activity.

#### The All-Encompassing Heart

The **heart**, unlike abstract consciousness, is a richer and more evocative symbol. It encompasses both emotional and spiritual dimensions, serving as the substratum where all experiences converge. It is the center of being, the luminous field where the divine and the human meet.

### Mantra Interpretation and Universal Applicability

The session briefly discusses the complexities of *mantra* interpretation, acknowledging the existence of diverse approaches and symbolisms. Abhinavagupta, however, emphasizes the need for a universally applicable commentary, accessible to practitioners across different traditions and time periods. He avoids getting entangled in sectarian interpretations, focusing on the core principles that resonate with all sincere seekers.

#### Balancing Clarity and Secrecy

While acknowledging the esoteric nature of *mantra*, Abhinavagupta balances the need for secrecy with clarity. He aims to provide a commentary that unveils the hidden meanings of *mantras* while respecting the sanctity of the tradition.

### Grace and Practice: A Harmonious Interplay

The session delves into the relationship between grace (*śaktipāta*) and spiritual practice, a fundamental theme in Trika philosophy. 

#### The Transformative Power of Grace

The session highlights the transformative power of grace, its capacity to purify the aspirant and bestow intuitive insight. Grace is likened to a divine spark that ignites the flame of self-realization within the individual.

#### The Importance of Continuous Discipline

While emphasizing the importance of grace, Abhinavagupta does not negate the need for continuous spiritual discipline. He advocates for a balanced approach, recognizing the role of both grace and effort in attaining liberation.

#### The Grindstone of Practice

Abhinavagupta uses the metaphor of grinding on a grindstone to depict the persistent and dedicated practice necessary for spiritual growth. He encourages the aspirant to engage in consistent effort, acknowledging that even those with doubts can experience glimpses of reality through committed practice. 

#### The Intensity of Grace

The session discusses the intensity of *śaktipātaḥ*, noting that it can lead to the physical death of the aspirant if fully realized in the body. The concept of *jīvanmuktaḥ* (liberated while living) requires a balanced interplay of grace and practice, where the aspirant gradually integrates the divine energy without being overwhelmed by its intensity.

#### Abhinavagupta's Humorous Approach

Abhinavagupta's unique approach is characterized by a blend of profound wisdom and humor. He uses playful language and relatable examples to convey complex philosophical concepts, making the teachings engaging and accessible.

### Conclusion: Embrace the Heart of Reality

This session of the Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa concludes by reiterating the key themes explored:

* **The Interconnectedness of All Things**: The principle of *sarvaṁ sarvātmakam* (everything is interconnected) underscores the unity of reality, where every part reflects the whole.
* **The Centrality of the Heart**: The **heart** is the locus of reality, the abode of the divine Śakti, and the source of all manifestation. 
* **The Transformative Power of Saṃjñāna**: Intuitive gnosis is the primary means of realizing the truth, transcending the limitations of rituals and external practices.
* **The Harmonious Interplay of Grace and Practice**: Liberation is attained through a balanced approach that integrates the divine grace with persistent spiritual discipline.

Abhinavagupta's commentary invites us to go beyond conceptual understanding and directly experience the heart of reality. By embracing the **heart** as the center of being and cultivating *saṃjñāna*, the aspirant can journey towards liberation and realize their inherent unity with the Divine.
