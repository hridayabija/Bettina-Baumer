## Abhinavagupta's Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa: Session 4 - A Deep Dive into Consciousness, Language, and Ritual

This session focuses on the concept of **anuttaram** (the Unsurpassable), the nature of the supreme dialogue (**paraṣaṁvād**) between Śiva and Śakti, and the relationship between knowledge (**jñāna**) and ritual (**kriyā**) in the context of liberation (**mukti**). It delves into Abhinavagupta's unique understanding of consciousness, language, and the interconnectedness of all things (**sarvam sarvātmakam**).

### 1. Opening the Session: Invocation and Summary Verses

The session begins with an invocation and the recitation of Sanskrit verses, highlighting the importance of incorporating these practices into the study of the **Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa**. 

#### a. Sanskrit Invocation Verses

The suggested verses for recitation are:

> *viśrāntiḥ paramā devi kālopatthivitarjitā* 
> *sarvakalpā vikalpānāṃ sarvāsāṃ saṃvidālayaḥ*

**Translation:**

> O Devi, the supreme repose, devoid of the limitations of time and space,
> You are the abode of all ideations and the dissolution of all forms of consciousness.

These verses, found on page 22 of the text, encapsulate the essence of the preceding section, emphasizing the **anuttaram** as the ultimate state of repose, free from the constraints of time and space. They also highlight the nature of the **anuttaram** as the ultimate ground of all conceptualizations (**vikalpa**) and the dissolution of all forms of limited consciousness.

#### b. Significance of the Verses

These verses are noteworthy for several reasons:

* **Authorship:** They are attributed to an inspired female composer, highlighting the feminine principle in spiritual knowledge.
* **Musicality:** Traditional Kashmiri tunes may accompany the recitation, connecting the text to a living tradition.
* **Summary Function:** They serve as summary verses, encapsulating the key ideas of the preceding section and providing a bridge to the subsequent discussion.

#### c. Prakrit Verses and the Continuity of Sanskrit

The presence of Prakrit verses in the manuscript is acknowledged, highlighting the historical context of the text and the challenges posed by the archaic nature of the language. The fact that these verses are difficult to understand even for experts underscores the continuous lineage of Sanskrit scholarship in contrast to the fragmented nature of Prakrit studies. This observation underscores the importance of Sanskrit as a key to unlocking the treasures of ancient Indian wisdom.

### 2. Unveiling the Dynamics of the Supreme Dialogue

The discussion shifts to the nature of the dialogue between the Devi and Bhairava, delving into the dynamics of **jñānaśakti** (the power of knowledge) and **rajasakti** (the expansive energy of manifestation).

#### a. jñānaśakti and its Expression

**jñānaśakti** is described as the supreme consciousness power, inseparable from Śiva. It is expressed in various forms, including **parāvāc** (the transcendent Word), **paśyanti** (the visionary Word), and **madhyamā** (the intermediary Word). This dynamic power is responsible for both the creation and dissolution of the universe, constantly engaging in a play of expansion and retraction.

#### b. The Devi as Questioner and Self-Questioner

The text emphasizes the active role of the Devi in this dialogue. She is not merely a passive recipient of knowledge but an active participant, posing questions and engaging in self-reflection. This dynamic is highlighted in the following quote:

> "The divine supreme consciousness power, not different from Śiva though on the point of expansion… is said to be **jñānaśakti**. **jñānaśakti vyukta vyavasayātmikā**, really not separate from Śiva."

This quote emphasizes the non-dual nature of Śiva and Śakti, highlighting **jñānaśakti** as the power of conscious will that drives the process of creation and dissolution.

#### c. The Perpetual Responder

Bhairava is depicted as the "perpetual responder," always ready to unveil the truth in response to the Devi's queries. This dynamic interplay between the questioner and the responder underscores the continuous dance of **prakāśa** (illumination) and **vimarśa** (reflection) at the heart of reality.

#### d. paraṣaṁvād: The Essence of Divine Dynamism

This ongoing dialogue between the Devi and Bhairava is termed **paraṣaṁvād**, the supreme dialogue. It represents the dynamic interplay of expansion and retraction, creation and dissolution, knowledge and action that characterizes the very nature of the Absolute. This dialogue is not limited to a specific time or place but is an eternal process, constantly unfolding within the heart of consciousness.

### 3. Perceiving the Subtlety of Divine Presence

The session explores the subtle nature of the Divine, drawing parallels with the imagery of tender rain from Abhinavagupta's stotra.

#### a. The Rain Metaphor

The verse from Abhinavagupta's stotra uses the simile of fine rain that is invisible against the vast expanse of the sky but becomes visible against the backdrop of trees and houses. This metaphor beautifully illustrates the subtle and all-pervasive nature of the Divine, which often eludes our perception.

#### b. The Need for Sensitivity and Training

Just as the perception of fine rain requires sensitivity and attentiveness, perceiving the Divine presence demands a refined awareness cultivated through spiritual practice. The story of the devotee of Bhagavān Rām who remained motionless for days to avoid disturbing the surrounding air and beings illustrates this point.

#### c. Non-Violence and Sensitivity

The Jaina principle of non-violence (**ahiṃsā**) is invoked as a parallel to this sensitivity, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the need for mindful action. This sensitivity goes beyond merely avoiding physical harm and extends to the subtle realm of thoughts, feelings, and intentions.

### 4. Anuttara: Deconstructing Hierarchies

The concept of **anuttaram** is further explored through its negation of various hierarchical structures.

#### a. Negation of the Upāya Hierarchy

**Anuttara** transcends the hierarchy of spiritual means (**upāya**), which are traditionally classified as:

* **śāmbhavopāya:** The divine way.
* **śāktopāya:** The way of energy.
* **āṇavopāya:** The individual way.

While these paths differ in their methods, they all ultimately lead to the same goal: realization of the **anuttaram**.

#### b. Challenging Other Hierarchies

Abhinavagupta goes on to challenge other hierarchical structures, including:

* **Hierarchy of Physical Elements:** The traditional hierarchy of earth, water, fire, air, and space is relativized, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all elements and their equal presence within the **anuttaram**.
* **Hierarchy of Mental States:** The states of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and **turīya** are not seen as fixed and separate but as fluid and interpenetrating states within the **anuttaram**.
* **Hierarchy of Social Classes:** The varṇa system, with its inherent hierarchy based on birth, is critiqued as artificial and irrelevant in the context of **anuttaram**.

#### c. Embracing Duality within Non-Duality

This deconstruction of hierarchies does not imply a rejection of multiplicity or differentiation. Abhinavagupta’s **paramādvaita** (supreme non-dualism) embraces duality within non-duality, recognizing the reality of the world while simultaneously affirming its ultimate identity with the Absolute.

### 5. Initiation: Gateway to Liberation and Its Transcendence

Meaning 13 of **anuttaram** explores the significance of initiation (**dīkṣā**) as a gateway to liberation and its ultimate transcendence.

#### a. The Process of Initiation

Abhinavagupta describes initiation as a process in which the Guru transmits their awakened consciousness to the disciple, setting in motion the disciple's spiritual journey. This transmission involves the central channel (**suṣumṇā**) and the interplay of **prāṇa** (outward breath) and **apāna** (inward breath).

#### b. The Limitations of Imposed Liberation

However, **anuttaram** transcends this imposed liberation. True liberation is not something bestowed from outside but is the inherent nature of consciousness itself. It is not a destination to be reached but a state to be recognized.

#### c. The Power of the Mantra

The mantra, particularly the **hṛdayabīja** (seed of the heart) SAUḤ, plays a crucial role in this process of self-recognition. The mantra is not merely a word to be recited but a potent symbol that activates the dormant **śakti** within the individual.

#### d. The Mantraśakti Beyond Ritual

The text emphasizes the transformative power of the **mantraśakti** (power of the mantra) beyond the limitations of external rituals. It is through the inner realization of the mantra, its resonance within the heart, that true liberation is attained.

### 6. Anuttara: The Affirmative Expression of Life

The discussion shifts from the negative connotations of the prefix *an* to a positive understanding of **anuttaram** as the expression of life itself.

#### a. An: The Root of Life

Meanings 14 and 15 of **anuttaram** are derived from the root *an*, which signifies "to breathe" and "to eat". These essential functions represent the fundamental expression of life in all beings.

#### b. Life Beyond the Individual

**Anuttara** transcends the limitations of the individual self (**śūnyapramātṛ**), recognizing the universal presence of life in all its forms. This understanding is expressed in the following quote:

> "Only the bodies appear as different. And that which is life appears in everyone without any distinction."

This quote highlights the underlying unity of all beings, emphasizing the all-pervasive nature of life as an expression of the **anuttaram**.

### 7. Anu Tara: Transcending Space and Time

Meaning 16 of **anuttaram** splits the word into *Anu Tara*, emphasizing the transcendence of space and time.

#### a. Anu: The Limitations of Duality

*Anu* signifies the limitations of successive actions (**karma**) within the duality of space and time. It represents the realm of the individual self, bound by the constraints of cause and effect.

#### b. Tara: The State Beyond Limitations

*Tara* represents the state beyond these limitations, the realm of the **anuttaram**. It signifies the transcendence of space and time, the realm of pure consciousness where duality is resolved into unity.

#### c. Ākāśa and Nirākāśa: Space and Spacelessness

The concepts of **ākāśa** (space) and **nirākāśa** (spacelessness) are invoked to illustrate this transcendence. **Ākāśa**, often symbolic of Brahman in the Upanishads, represents the boundless expanse within which manifestation occurs. **Nirākāśa** signifies the state beyond space, the unconditioned realm of the **anuttaram**.

#### d. Matsyodari: The Simile of the Fish

The simile of the **matsyodari** (the throbbing of the fish's belly) is used to describe the **spanda** (vibration) of consciousness. This simile represents the ceaseless dynamism of consciousness that is not bound by the limitations of time or space. It signifies the successionless nature of the **anuttaram**, its ever-present and dynamic reality.

### 8. Kaulika Siddhi: Embracing the Totality

The session delves into the concept of **kaulika siddhi**, exploring the meaning of *kula* and *kaula*.

#### a. Kula: The Cosmic Body

*Kula* is a multi-layered term that encompasses various meanings, including:

* **Family:** Representing a unit of interconnected individuals.
* **Energy:** Signifying the dynamic power that animates the universe.
* **Totality:** Encompassing all levels of existence.
* **Body:** Representing the microcosm, a reflection of the macrocosm.
* **Cosmos:** Representing the macrocosm, the totality of manifestation.

The common thread linking these meanings is the concept of an organic whole with interconnected parts, a totality that is both unified and diverse.

#### b. Kaula/Kaulika: Relating to the Supreme Shakti

*Kaula* and *kaulika* are terms related to *kula*, often referring to the supreme aspect of divine energy, the **Kauliki Shakti**. This energy is responsible for the manifestation of the universe and is the power through which the individual can attain liberation.

#### c. Akula: Shiva Transcending Multiplicity

*Akula* represents Śiva, the transcendent principle that lies beyond the multiplicity of the cosmos. It signifies the unmanifest, unconditioned ground of all existence.

#### d. Kaulika Siddhi: Participation and Identification

**Kaulika siddhi** is the perfection achieved through participation in and identification with the **Kauliki Shakti**. It represents the merging of the individual consciousness with the divine creative energy, the realization of oneness with the totality of existence.

#### e. The Importance of Kula

Despite the supremacy of Trika in Abhinavagupta's system, he acknowledges the importance of **kula**, describing its presence as the subtle essence within all Tantric scriptures.

> "the fragrance in the flower… the oil in the sesame seed… the living soul in the body and the taste in water… the *kula* is present in several Shastras with their essence"

#### f. Kauliki Shakti: The Bridge to the Absolute

The **Kauliki Shakti** acts as the bridge between the individual (**aṇu**) and the Absolute (**akula**), enabling the aspirant to transcend the limitations of their individual existence and merge with the totality of consciousness.

### 9. Kaulika Siddhi: Affirmation and Coagulation

Abhinavagupta's interpretation of **Kaulika siddhi** emphasizes affirmation rather than negation, encompassing all levels of existence within the totality of *kula*.

#### a. Consciousness in All Forms

Consciousness (**cit**) is seen as pervading all forms of objectivity, even in the seemingly inert realm of matter. This understanding challenges the traditional separation between spirit and matter, recognizing the underlying unity of all existence.

#### b. Coagulation: Condensation of Consciousness

Matter is understood as a coagulation of consciousness, a condensation of the **cit śakti**. This concept is beautifully illustrated in the following verse:

> *Ājñāna- timirandhasya jñāna añjana śalākayā* 
> *cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī gurave namaḥ*

**Translation:**

> I bow to the glorious Guru who, with the collyrium stick of knowledge,
> Has opened the eyes of one blinded by the darkness of ignorance.

This verse highlights the transformative power of knowledge in removing the veils of ignorance that obscure our perception of the true nature of reality.

#### c. Rasa: The Essence of Dynamism

The term **rasa** (essence, liquidity, dynamism) is used to describe this subtle presence of consciousness within matter. It suggests that even the seemingly solid and inert is, in essence, a dynamic and pulsating expression of consciousness.

#### d. Quantum Physics and Śaiva Cosmology

A parallel is drawn between the insights of quantum physics and Śaiva cosmology, both of which challenge the traditional understanding of matter and its relationship to consciousness. Both recognize the fundamental interconnectedness and dynamism of all existence, blurring the boundaries between the observer and the observed.

### 10. Concluding Thoughts: Towards a Holistic Vision

The session concludes by reiterating the comprehensive nature of Abhinavagupta's approach, embracing both duality and non-duality, affirmation and negation.

#### a. Anuttara: Transcending Hierarchies

**Anuttara**, by questioning and transcending hierarchical structures, liberates the individual from projections and identifications. It reveals the inherent interconnectedness of all things, promoting a holistic vision of reality where every aspect of existence is recognized as an expression of the Divine.

#### b. The Tautology of Anuttara

The seemingly tautological nature of **anuttaram**, its presence in both the manifest and unmanifest, is not a contradiction but rather an affirmation of its all-encompassing reality. It is precisely because **anuttaram** is the ultimate ground of all existence that it is present in every aspect of creation.

#### c. Embracing Multiplicity within Unity

Abhinavagupta's philosophy embraces multiplicity within unity, recognizing the diversity of the world while simultaneously affirming its ultimate identity with the Absolute. This approach transcends the limitations of monism and dualism, offering a profound vision of interconnectedness.

#### d. The Importance of Experience

The session concludes with a reminder that this knowledge is not merely theoretical but is to be realized through direct experience (**anubhava**). It is through spiritual practice and the grace of the Guru that the aspirant can awaken to the reality of **anuttaram** and attain liberation.

This session provides a profound exploration of the key concepts of the **Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa**, emphasizing the dynamic interplay of consciousness, language, and ritual in the pursuit of liberation. It reveals the interconnectedness of all things and challenges us to embrace a holistic vision of reality, recognizing the Divine presence in every aspect of existence.
