##  Abhinavagupta's Commentary on the First Verse of the Parātrīśikā: Unveiling the Unsurpassable Through Grace and the Power of Vāk

This session delves into the second part of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the first verse of the Parātrīśikā Tantra, a seminal text within the tradition of non-dualistic Kashmir Śaivism. The commentary explores profound philosophical concepts relating to the nature of ultimate reality (Anuttara), the role of divine grace (anugraha) in achieving liberation, and the power of language (*vāk*) as a tool for both revelation and realization. 

### Recap: Setting the Stage

The session begins by reiterating the importance of patient absorption of the text, allowing time for its profound insights to settle within the reader's consciousness. It draws parallels to the recitation of an upaniṣad and the story of baby Krishna in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, highlighting the tantra's function as a catalyst for spiritual ascent, launching the practitioner into higher realms of awareness.

### Non-dualism: The Dissolving of Duality

The commentary revisits the concept of non-dualism, central to both Advaita Vedānta and Kashmir Śaivism. The upaniṣadic notion that "Consciousness itself becomes question and answer in the position of master and disciple" is emphasized, underscoring the ultimate insubstantiality of the distinction between guru and disciple. This is explained by the understanding that consciousness, through its inherent freedom (*svātantrya*), manifests diverse forms within itself, including the seemingly separate roles of teacher and student.  Ultimately, at the level of pure consciousness (parā devī), there is no inherent separation, question, or answer, only the unified reality of the Self. 

### Abhinavagupta's Commentary: The Foundation of Grace

Abhinavagupta's commentary on the first verse of the Parātrīśikā begins with the term **anuttaram** (the unsurpassable), signifying the central focus of the text – the nature of ultimate reality. He then introduces the doctrine of Shiva's five acts (pañcakṛtya):

*   *sṛṣṭi* (emanation)
*   *sthiti* (maintenance)
*   *saṃhāra* (reabsorption)
*   *tirodhāna* (concealing)
*   *anugraha* (grace)

By highlighting these five acts, Abhinavagupta immediately underscores the importance of **grace** (*anugraha*) in the process of enlightenment. He emphasizes that Shiva is not merely engaged in these acts, but is inherently grace itself, always united with parā śakti, whose very nature is grace. The term **ākrānta**, meaning "overwhelmed," is used to describe Shiva's state in relation to parā śakti, further signifying the primacy of grace.

**Quote from Abhinavagupta's Commentary (Sanskrit):**

> Parameśvaraḥ paracittakṛtyamayaḥ satataṃ anugṛhamayo yathā śaktyā āyuṣaḥ parārthopāyaśaktyā ākānte ākānto astikaram anugṛha eva ātmaivā na hi śaktiśivād bhedamā ātmāśritaḥ

**Translation:**

> The Supreme Lord, ever engaged in the fivefold act of consciousness, is always full of grace. Overwhelmed by the Power of Grace, which aims at the well-being of others, He bestows grace as the very nature of His Being. Indeed, there is no distinction between Shiva and Shakti, as the Power is always one with Him.

This passage elucidates the fundamental importance of grace in achieving sudden enlightenment, contrasting it with the limitations of mere effort through ritual or yoga. The attraction towards this type of teaching itself suggests a degree of received grace, with nine degrees described by Abhinavagupta in Tantrāloka and Tantrasāra.  Mental confusion is identified as the primary obstacle to realizing this inherent grace.

### Vāk: The Unveiling Power of Speech

To delve deeper into the nature of revelation and realization, Abhinavagupta introduces the four levels of *vāk* (speech):

1.  **Parā:** The supreme, undifferentiated level of *vāk*. It is the source of all thoughts and language, transcending both.
2.  **Paśyantī:** The "seeing" level of *vāk*. It is atemporal and intuitive, where meaning is apprehended holistically without sequential thought. This level is crucial for understanding scriptures, poetry, music, and other forms of expression at a non-technical, non-sequential level.
3.  **Madhyamā:** The intermediate level of *vāk*, lying between **paśyantī** and **vaikharī**.  Here, thoughts begin to take shape and structure language, preparing for outward expression.
4.  **Vaikharī:** The outermost level of *vāk*, representing the outward expression of language through vocal organs or instruments.

**Paśyantī: The Bridge Between Transcendence and Expression**

Abhinavagupta begins his analysis with **paśyantī** because it serves as the crucial bridge between the transcendental source (parā) and outward expression. It is at this level that revelation occurs, where the Divine communicates through intuitive insight, bypassing the limitations of conceptual thought. Understanding scriptures, art, poetry, and music at their deepest levels happens through accessing this intuitive, atemporal mode of perception.

**Quote from Abhinavagupta's Commentary (Sanskrit):**

> sā eva sakala-pramātṛ-saṃvit prajñāmai tadameva vartamāna-rūpā tas tu paśyanty ṛgbhyaḥ abhicitaṃ tadameva samcita-vedānta-śāstrābhyaḥ tāvat paśyantir ut utaviśeṣaḥ utkṛṣṭa-jñāna-viśāradānaiḥ paraṃ tadameva parama-mataram paramaha mantramayām adeśa-kāla-talitāyāṃ samvitti virājate

**Translation:**

> She, the all-encompassing Consciousness of every perceiver, shines forth as Knowledge. This very Awareness, in the form of the Present, is known as paśyantī from the Vedas. This very paśyantī is also known from the collected Vedānta texts. Moreover, those who are skilled in the highest Knowledge experience this supreme paśyantī, which is rooted in the divine I-consciousness, the highest Mantra, pervading the Consciousness that is beyond space and time.

**Aham: The Power of I-consciousness**

The commentary emphasizes the importance of the mantra "aham" (I-consciousness) as the underlying power of all mantras. "Aham" does not refer to the individual ego, but to the universal I-consciousness that pervades all beings. Without this I-consciousness, mantras are likened to "autumn clouds" – moving but incapable of producing rain.  It is the soul consciousness, yet transcends individuality.

### Revelation: Beyond Thought

The session emphasizes that revelation happens at the level of **paśyantī**, bypassing the limitations of sequential thought. It is through accessing this intuitive level that we can truly understand scriptures, art, and other forms of Divine communication.

### Parā Vāk: Ever-Present in Experience

Abhinavagupta reiterates that parā vāk, non-dual and identical with supreme consciousness, is not a distant concept but is ever-present in our experience.  It is the consciousness that pervades all beings.

**Quote from Abhinavagupta's Commentary (Sanskrit):**

> saiva sakalapramāṇe saṁvidadvayamayiḥ tata tāmevātmānaṁ rūpaṁ tasmāt paśyanti yat yat abhipratiṣṭhitaṁ tat tadīva samutthitaṁ draṣṭṛrūpaṁ tāvat paśyanti ut uttaviśeṣaḥ utīkartavyaḥ yathā vibhāgye mātraṁ vartete nāmadheyāni sarva prathamataraṁ paramahaṁmantramayāṁ adeśakālakalitāyāṁ saṁvit vimṛśati

**Translation:**

> She, the Parā Vāk, is present as non-dual Consciousness in every subject of experience. Therefore, from this very Parā Vāk, whatever is established in paśyantī appears as the perceiver. Thus, paśyantī is to be understood as the stage where differentiation begins to manifest. All names and forms arise from this primordial, supreme-mantra-pervaded Consciousness that is beyond space and time.

This passage highlights the omnipresence of parā vāk, suggesting that as our consciousness expands, we become more attuned to this universal, interconnected awareness.

### Vikalpa: From Intuition to Conceptualization

The commentary further explores the emergence of *vikalpa* (conceptualization) from *pratibhāśā* (intuitive flash). Even within *pratibhāśā*, the seed of *vikalpa* exists, but it is a pure thought (*śuddha ekāgratā*) that leads to genuine creativity, not the confused thoughts (*vikalpas*) of the ordinary mind.

### Paśyantī, Madhyamā, and the Divine Attributes

Abhinavagupta connects the levels of *vāk* to the divine attributes, explaining that **paśyantī** represents the beginning of differentiation, while **madhyamā** signifies the further emergence of difference. These correspond to *jñāna* (knowledge) and *kriyā* (action), the predominant attributes of Sadāśiva and Īśvara, respectively. This connection highlights the dynamic interplay between consciousness and its manifestation, reflecting the non-dual yet dynamic nature of reality.

### The Universal I-consciousness: Embracing Innumerable Universes

The commentary emphasizes the vastness of the universal I-consciousness, extending beyond a single universe to encompass countless universes, aligning with modern cosmological concepts of a multiverse and an expanding universe. 

### Devī: The Embodiment of Parā Śakti and Supreme Consciousness

The commentary culminates in the identification of Devī with parā śakti and supreme consciousness.  Devī is not a separate entity from consciousness, but is that all-pervasive consciousness itself, embodying the dynamic creative power that manifests as both the universe and the means for its realization. 

### Conclusion: Towards the Heart of the Mantra

The second session concludes by underlining the profound insights contained within Abhinavagupta's commentary on the first verse of the Parātrīśikā. It highlights the crucial roles of:

*   The four levels of *vāk*
*   The bridge of **paśyantī**
*   The power of the mantra "aham"
*   The ultimate identity of Devī with parā śakti and supreme consciousness

These concepts lay the groundwork for further exploration of the text's esoteric teachings, guiding the reader towards an experiential understanding of the unsurpassable reality through the power of *vāk*, grace, and the "seed of the heart" (hṛdayabīja).
