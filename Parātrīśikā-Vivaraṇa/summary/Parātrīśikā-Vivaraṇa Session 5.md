## Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa Session 5: A Detailed Summary and Retelling

This session delves into the profound concept of **kevalī saṃghaṭa**, a state of perfect harmony with the dynamic energy of Shakti, the Supreme Divine Energy. Abhinavagupta, the renowned Kashmiri Shaiva philosopher and mystic, emphasizes the importance of authentic interpretation of Tantric scriptures and criticizes misleading commentaries that deviate from the tradition. He meticulously explores the interconnectedness of all levels of reality, highlighting the concept of **sarvaṁ sarvātmakam**, where everything is related to the totality, a principle deeply embedded in the non-dualistic philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism. 

### 1. Introduction: The Importance of Authentic Interpretation

* **Sensitivity of Tantras:**

    * Tantras, being esoteric and symbolic, are prone to misinterpretations.
    * Abhinavagupta, a staunch advocate of tradition and experience, stresses the significance of precise interpretation (*vivaraṇa*) grounded in the *sampradāya* (lineage of teachers) and personal realization. 
    * He cautions against misinterpretations that arise from intellectual speculation devoid of experiential understanding.

* **Somananda's Legacy:**

    * Abhinavagupta holds Somananda, his Paramēśthiguru (guru of Paramēśvara), in high esteem. 
    * Somananda’s commentary on the Parātrīśikā, though mostly lost, is lauded for its clarity, brevity, and insightful approach, highlighting its significance as a source of authentic interpretation.

* **Criticisms of Misleading Commentaries:**

    * Abhinavagupta critiques commentaries that lack experiential and traditional grounding, emphasizing that authentic interpretation should not be based solely on intellectual analysis or personal opinions.
    * He champions the importance of adhering to the *sampradāya* and relying on the insights of realized masters.

* **Quote from an Unknown Source:**

    > "O Lord, I have heard the description of the spiritual knowledge pertaining to *trika*, and so through your favor I have also acquired knowledge pertaining to *trika*."

    * This quote reflects the importance of receiving teachings within a lineage, as knowledge transmitted through a *guru* (spiritual teacher) is considered more potent and authentic.

* **Benefits of Authentic Commentaries:**

    > "Therefore that which the teachers have taught in accordance with the commentary of venerable Somananda will also do good to all good to all his children." (*tateva sarvasya pramuktiśunāṃ*)

    * Authentic commentaries, based on the *sampradāya* and the insights of realized masters, are deemed beneficial and auspicious, leading to liberation (*mukti*) for all sincere seekers.

* **Abhinavagupta's Commentary:**

    > "Abhinavagupta has made a blessing Somananda commentary manifest that is bent on extirpating the darkness due to misleading wretched commentaries lacking the refinement of good teaching and tradition that makes the heart lotus his own commentary that makes the heart lotus purified by the discipline of *trika* bloom. That by its flashing luster melts the accumulated spleen of the fools."

    * Abhinavagupta's commentary aims to illuminate the true meaning of the Parātrīśikā, dispelling the darkness of ignorance (*ajñāna*) and removing the obstacles (*mala*) that hinder spiritual progress.
    * His commentary seeks to purify the hearts of seekers, enabling them to blossom like a lotus, symbolic of spiritual awakening and the unfolding of consciousness.
    * This purification is facilitated by the authentic teachings of *trika* (*śāstra*, *vidyā*) received within the *sampradāya*.

* **Preservation of Authentic Texts:**

    * The survival of specific manuscripts through centuries of copying and recopying indicates their acceptance and value within the *sampradāya*.
    * Texts considered inaccurate or deviating from the tradition were likely not recopied, leading to their eventual disappearance.
    * This process underscores the importance of textual transmission and the role of the *sampradāya* in preserving authentic teachings.

### 2. Kālikā City and Anuttara: The Intertwined Nature of Perfection

* **Alotaṃ and Kālikā City:**

    * The term *alotaṃ*, denoting perfection (*anuttara*), is intricately linked to the concept of *kālikā city*.
    * *Kālikā city*, symbolic of the divine realm or the state of liberation, naturally arises as a consequence of realizing *anuttara*.
    * This connection highlights the inseparability of the absolute reality (*Brahman*) from its manifestation as the universe.

* **Tantric Understanding of the Absolute:**

    * The Tantric perspective posits the Absolute as actively involved in the cosmic dance of creation and dissolution, not a distant, detached entity.
    * This dynamic understanding of *Brahman* emphasizes its fullness and inclusiveness, encompassing the body, cosmos, and all levels of reality.

* **Relationship between Anuttara and Kaulikasiddhi:**

    * *Anuttara* is not merely a theoretical concept or an abstract goal, but a state of being that naturally bestows *kaulikasiddhi*, the "perfection of the *kula*".
    * *Kaulikasiddhi* signifies the complete integration and harmonization of the individual with the *kula*, the totality of existence, encompassing the body, the cosmos, and all levels of reality.
    * It represents the full realization of the non-dual nature of reality, where the individual recognizes their inherent oneness with the Divine.

* **Chit-Chaitanya-Samatā:**

    * The ultimate aim of spiritual practice is *chit-chaitanya-samatā*, the "equality of consciousness," as expressed in the phrase: > "Yenābhivyaktāmatreṇa kechit chaitanyasamātāṃ vrajanti."

    * This state of *samatā* (equality) represents a balanced and harmonious consciousness, free from the fluctuations of duality and the limitations of the ego.
    * It signifies the merging of the individual consciousness with the universal consciousness, recognizing the inherent divinity within all beings.

* **Manifestation and Consciousness:**

    * Abhinavagupta underscores the foundational role of consciousness in the manifestation of the universe. 
    * Nothing can come into existence without the light (*prakāśa*) of consciousness, which illuminates and gives form to all phenomena.

* **Kauliki and Universal Consciousness:**

    * *Kauliki*, the power of the *kula*, facilitates the realization of bliss (*ānanda*) by leading the seeker to grasp the principle of universal consciousness.
    * This realization involves a "turning around" (*parivṛtya*) of awareness, from the external world of objects to the inner realm of the Self.

* **Kule Jatasiddhi:**

    > "kule jatasiddhi kule jatasiddhi" (from Shiva Drishti)

    * This phrase highlights the inseparable connection between the *kula* (totality) and the *siddhi* (perfection) attained within it.
    * The *kaulika siddhanta* connects the yogi who visualizes *anuttara* to its divine body, which manifests in the multiplicity of the universe.
    * This connection is not forced or predetermined, but arises spontaneously from the absolute freedom (*svātantrya*) of the Divine.

* **Divine Freedom and Infinite Possibilities:**

    * *Svātantrya* (divine freedom) is a central tenet of Kashmir Shaivism, representing the ultimate power of the Divine to manifest the universe in infinite ways.
    * This freedom allows for endless possibilities within consciousness, making the creation a spontaneous and ever-unfolding expression of the divine will.
    * The apparent limitations and dualities of the world are not seen as constraints, but as a reflection of the Divine's playful self-expression.

### 3. Satya and the Concept of Time

* **Relativity of Time:**

    * The concept of "day" is not absolute but relative, varying depending on the perspective: human, Brahma, yogi, or Vishnu.
    * Each level of being experiences time differently, demonstrating its fluid and subjective nature.
    * Abhinavagupta emphasizes that consciousness transcends the limitations of linear, sequential time, which is a construct of the mind.

* **Satya as Simultaneousness:**

    * In this context, ***satya*** does not denote truth in a general sense but refers to simultaneity, not in terms of chronological time, but as a state of being that "terminates in reality" (*paryavasāyi tad-tad-paryavasāyi*).
    * This simultaneity signifies the ever-present nature of the Absolute, which is not bound by the limitations of past, present, or future.

* **Satya and Sat:**

    * Linking ***satya*** (simultaneity) with *sat* (being) reinforces the understanding of reality as a totality, existing beyond temporal constraints.
    * *Sat* represents the pure, unconditioned existence of the Absolute, while ***satya*** signifies its manifestation as the ever-present, dynamic universe.

* **Kula as the Collective Form:**

    * *Kula*, the totality of objectivity, is conceived as the collective form of the divine rays emanating from the sun of consciousness.
    * This imagery emphasizes the luminous and vital nature of *kula*, representing the dynamic energy of the Divine expressing itself in the universe.

* **Anuttara and Ananda:**

    * When *kula* identifies with the inner supramental consciousness, it transcends the limitations of duality and becomes filled with the nectar of supreme bliss (*ānanda*).
    * This blissful state of perfect integration is *anuttara*, the unsurpassable, the Absolute.
    * This realization is described as *satchidananda*, the blissful union of being (*sat*), consciousness (*chit*), and bliss (*ānanda*), representing the ultimate reality.

### 4. Vijñātamataṁ: Unveiling the Unknown through Recognition

* **Vedic Interpretation:**

    > "yena vijñātaṁ mataṁ jñātaṁ" 

    * This phrase from the Vedas refers to the realization of the true nature of the Self through *vijñāna*, a term denoting mystical knowledge, not scientific knowledge in the modern sense.

* **Anuttara and Mataṁ:**

    * *Anuttara*, the Absolute, is that by which *mataṁ* (the analyzed essence of knowledge within) is understood.
    * *Mataṁ* can also be interpreted as that which is already inherently known, requiring only recognition, not new acquisition of knowledge.

* **Relativity of Knowledge:**

    * True knowledge, in this context, is not about gaining information about external objects but about recognizing the Self, the true subject of all experience.
    * This recognition is a process of remembering or reawakening to one's inherent divine nature, which is often obscured by the veil of ignorance.

* **Jñātamataṁ and Māyā:**

    * *Jñātamataṁ* refers to that which is perceived and known as an object, including *māyā* (illusion), which appears as an external reality.
    * However, in the realization of *anuttara*, both known objects and *māyā* cease to be perceived as external and are assimilated into the unity of consciousness.

* **Vijñātamattareṇa:**

    * This term represents the state where the distinction between subject (knower) and object (known) dissolves.
    * It signifies the merging of duality into the unity of consciousness, where the object is no longer perceived as separate from the subject.
    * This state transcends the limitations of conceptual knowledge and reveals the light (*prakāśa*) of consciousness that illuminates all phenomena.

* **Three Key Ideas:**

    1. *Anuttara* is self-sustaining and serves as the foundation for all aspects and phases of knowledge (*pramāṇa*, *prameya*, *pramita*).
    2. Once the Self is recognized, it requires no further validation or support through external practices or means of knowledge.
    3. The object of inquiry, being a projection of consciousness, cannot replace the subject, preventing the endless proliferation of *vikalpa* (conceptual distinctions).

### 5. Kevala-Samādhi: The Ultimate Goal of the Yogakāra

* **Kevala-Samādhi as the Focus:**

    * The ultimate aim of a *Yogakāra* (practitioner of Yoga) is to attain *kevala-samādhi*, a state of perfect and complete absorption in the Self.
    * The initial verses of the Parātrīśikā are powerful pointers directing the seeker towards this ultimate state of realization.

* **Jñāna-Vikālpam-Athena:**

    * The *yoginī* (female practitioner of Yoga), who poses the question in the Parātrīśikā, is already established in *jñāna-vikālpam-athena*, "knowledge free from conceptual proliferation", indicating a high level of spiritual attainment.
    * Her inquiry is focused on attaining *kevala-samādhi*, which transcends even the subtlest distinctions and leads to the complete merging with the Absolute.

* **Understanding Kevala-Samādhi:**

    * Abhinavagupta provides detailed explanations of *kevala-samādhi*, emphasizing its importance as the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.
    * It represents the culmination of the yogic path, where all mental fluctuations cease and the individual consciousness dissolves into the ocean of pure, undifferentiated awareness.
    * In this state, the sense of duality completely disappears, and the yogi experiences the blissful union with the Divine.

### 6. Kevala and Kecharī: Exploring the Dynamics of Shakti

* **Feminine and Masculine Kevala:**

    * *Kevala*, primarily feminine, represents Shakti, the dynamic force of the Absolute. However, it also has a masculine form, signifying the *yogin* who attains that state.
    * This dual aspect highlights the union of Shiva (the static principle) and Shakti (the dynamic principle) in the state of *kevala-samādhi*.

* **Kha and Consciousness:**

    * *Kha* denotes space, but not merely physical space. It signifies the boundless expanse of consciousness, the realm of *Brahman*, where the limitations of duality are transcended.
    * It also refers to the openings in the body, specifically the sense organs, which act as gateways connecting the inner realm of consciousness with the outer world of phenomena.

* **Kecharī: Moving in the Space of Consciousness:**

    * *Kecharī* refers to the Śakti who moves freely in the infinite space of consciousness (*kha*, *ākāśa*, *vyoman*).
    * It can also be translated as "moving in the void" (*śūnyatā*), signifying the transcendence of all limitations and the realization of the non-dual nature of reality.

* **Yoginīs and Supernatural Powers:**

    * In early Tantric texts, *kecharī* represents a class of *yoginīs*, feminine deities associated with spiritual power and the ability to bestow supernatural abilities (*siddhis*).
    * However, these *yoginīs* can also represent obstacles or distractions on the spiritual path if the seeker is not adequately prepared or if their intentions are not pure.

* **Kecharī as Shakti and Prāṇa:**

    * *Kecharī* is both a name for Shakti herself, the ultimate power of the Absolute, and one of the five *pañca-prāṇa* (vital energies) in the yogic system.
    * It is connected to the *shakticakra* (wheel of energies) in the common Tantric understanding, representing a specific level of energy and consciousness within the subtle body.

* **Kecharī Mudrā:**

    * *Kecharī mudrā* is a physical and mystical gesture that involves turning the tongue back into the nasal cavity, stimulating the flow of *prāṇa* (vital energy) and facilitating a profound state of inner awareness.
    * Abhinavagupta considers *kecharī mudrā* the highest *mudrā* (gesture) in the yogic system, signifying the internalization of awareness and the transcendence of duality.

### 7. Kevalī Saṃghaṭa: Harmony with the Dynamic Energy of Shakti

* **Kevalī and Dynamism:**

    * The term *kevalī*, like *kecharī*, is inherently dynamic due to its association with Shakti, the active, creative force of the Absolute.
    * It represents the highest energy, not bound by limitations of the physical realm, capable of manifesting and withdrawing the universe through its spontaneous power.

* **Levels of Kevalī:**

    * Abhinavagupta interprets *kevalī* through five levels, representing different aspects of Shakti's power operating in various realms: 

       1. **Kevalī:** The level of the sense organs, where the *śakti* governs sensory perception and the initial interaction with the world.
       2. **Kevalī:** The level of the inner instruments (*antaḥkaraṇa*), where the *śakti* influences mental activity, thoughts, and emotions.
       3. **Kevalī:** The level of the outer senses (*bahiṣkaraṇa*), where the *śakti* governs actions and interactions with the external world.
       4. **Kevalī:** The level of objective existences, where the *śakti* manifests as the various objects and phenomena of the universe.
       5. **Kevalī saṃvit:** The highest level, representing pure consciousness, the ultimate source of all manifestation and the essence of *kevalī*.

* **Abhinavagupta's Commentary on Kevalī:**

    > "The meaning of *kevalī* is as follows: That Śakti is *kevalī* who abiding in the heart that is *saṃvit* which is identical with herself roams about the distinctions in various ways. Generally, this *kevalī*, having a universal aspect, functions in three ways: She as *kevalī* brings about the knowledge of objects. This *kevalī* effects movements such as grasping, relinquishing, et cetera. As *kevalī* exists in the form of objective existences." 

    * This passage emphasizes the dynamic and all-pervasive nature of *kevalī*, operating at different levels of reality, from the inner instruments to the outer world of objects.

* **Levels of Shakti in Individual Aspects:**

    * **Vyūmacaryā** (moving in the void of consciousness), *vyūma* (the void of consciousness itself), *antaḥkaraṇa* (inner instruments), *bahiṣkaraṇa* (outer senses), and the powers of existence represent different levels of Shakti's manifestation in individual beings.
    * However, these seemingly distinct levels are ultimately non-different from the *kevalī* residing in the essential nature as *saṃvit* (consciousness).

* **Unity of Supreme Divine Energy:**

    > "Thus that Śakti of the supreme Lord is *saṃvit* alone, they are not different from *kevalī* which is the power of which is the power of consciousness. It is *eka*. *eka eva sa parameśvarī śakti*."

    * Abhinavagupta reiterates the fundamental unity of the Supreme Divine Energy (*Śakti*), emphasizing that the different levels and functions of *kevalī* are merely aspects of this singular, all-pervading power.

* **Śakti and Maheśvara:**

    > "Śaktyā yuktasya jagat kṛtsnam śaktimān svā maheśvaraḥ"

    * This statement highlights the dynamic relationship between Śakti and Maheśvara (Shiva).
    * While the entire universe is constituted by the energies of Śakti, Maheśvara is the ultimate source and possessor of these energies.

* **Svātantrya Śakti:**

    * Maheśvara's manifestation as *svātantrya śakti* (power of absolute freedom) underscores the spontaneous and creative nature of the universe.
    * This freedom allows for infinite possibilities within consciousness, making creation a dynamic and ever-evolving expression of the divine will.

* **Interconnectedness of Kevalī's Functions:**

    * Abhinavagupta argues against a rigid separation between the different functions of *kevalī*.
    * He emphasizes the inherent interconnectedness of *kevalī śakti*, *kevalī*, *vikcaryā*, and *kevalī*, recognizing them as different expressions of the same underlying power of consciousness.

* **Conclusion:**

    * The session concludes by drawing a parallel between the levels of *kevalī* and the four levels of speech (*parā*, *paśyantī*, *madhyamā*, *vaikharī*). 
    * This comparison highlights the correspondence between the unfolding of consciousness and the manifestation of language, both arising from the same source, the Supreme Word (*parā vāk*).
    * The session ultimately emphasizes the dynamic and all-encompassing nature of *kevalī*, its profound connection to consciousness, and its role as a key to realizing *kevala-samādhi*, the state of complete absorption in the Self.

This summary and retelling aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts discussed in the Parātrīśikā-Vivaraṇa Session 5, including *anuttara*, *kālikā city*, *kevala-samādhi*, *kevalī*, and *kecharī*. By meticulously analyzing the text and incorporating all details, keywords, and ideas, this document strives to illuminate the profound insights offered by Abhinavagupta on the nature of consciousness, Shakti, and the manifestation of the universe within the framework of non-dualistic Kashmir Shaivism.
