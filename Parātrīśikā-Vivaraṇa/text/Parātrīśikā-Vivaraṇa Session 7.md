We start with the first mantra, first verse. And then we can begin the commentary. We start with the first Mantra polluted First verse, and then we can begin the commentary. Anantaruṃ gatam devāstatvyamaulikasiddhidam. Yenavidyātamātreṇa kecitsamprati. Anantaruṃ gatam devāstatvyamaulikasiddhidam. Yenavidyātamātreṇa kecitsamprati. 

But then, I was just now in Srinagar for giving a lecture and a Sufi seminar. And they had hardly started my lecture, the authorities said that we have an alert. My wife and also some other people said "No, it is safe." But what strikes me almost every such retreat, we read a similar Psalm or other disasters. What I said the frequency or infrequency of my seminar, or the frequency of the disasters. But, it is incredible. I had this already for in Tamil Nadu, tsunami. And then we had planned a seminar in Srinagar. Then the great flood in Srinagar. Then, I was just now in Srinagar for giving a lecture at the Sufi seminar, and they had hardly started my lecture, the authorities said that we have an alert. My wife and also some other friends said, "No, it is safe." But what strikes me, because I'm confronted with so many of these disasters. I was in Orissa for my field work on the temples, and then supercyclone. In the middle of it. What strikes me that we have been dealing yesterday with the *kecitsamatā* and *kṣetravaiṣamyā*. That, but what we are doing here is not an esoteric, ivory tower, um, dealing with this very high spiritual, traditional texts, and so on. But, it is, as we have said also yesterday, the whole interpretation of *Samatā*, it cannot be detached from what is going on around us in the world, etc. And, it is also to me, it is very clear that the cause of violent nature is protesting or reacting so forcefully because, we have understood *vaiṣamyā*. We, in this humanity. Whether it does not matter anymore, the geographical border, but, nature just reacts against all this *vaiṣamyā*, all this disharmony, this tension, and so on. And, that is why, um, going deep into such a spiritual tradition, should never be seen as escaping from this worldly realities. That also way to go to to reach state of *Samatā*. And if we reach it then it will reduce a lot. So, that is how we should not be disconnected, even though, not from this TV or anything like that. It's enough to know. And, then, to take it inside and internalize them. Make our spiritual practice more serious, more responsible. So, this, uh, just a reflection. And, this whole sequence of earthquake, flood or this, we are suffering so many natural disasters, etc. something like that. It was an earthquake and war violence. So, our aim that teach this *Samatā* is very serious for our own integration and for the integration of the whole world. It sounds pretentious, but it is not, because, every individual and they know who must change the world? Not the politicians, or the Saints. So, everyone contributes to this *Samatā*. Freedom, individual. 

Now, before we proceed with the other part of the question of the Devi, um, the wonderful thing of a real master like my *Gurudev* Lakṣmaṇjū who are so steeped in tradition and so living in totality is that, they can express very complex matter in very simple terms. Of course, I cannot put that here. He's a master of expressing it in very complex thing. But, I found a definition by Lakṣmaṇjū of what is *Kula*? And we will see much summer by him. And, uh, not simplistic, but very clear with what we have been doing. So far. It's not complexity. Creating *Samatā*. 

> When he defines what is *Kula*? The *Kula* system teaches you how you can live in eternity, your universal consciousness, the real nature of yourself. Both ascending and the descending act. Why do you rise from the lowest to the highest? You realize your nature. And, why descend from the highest to the lowest, you realize your nature. In the *Kula* system, there is no break in the realization of your own nature. Either, in the highest circle or the lowest circle. This system, therefore, teaches you how you can live in totality. That totality is the translation of *Kula*. In fact, the word "*Kula*" means "totality." In the practice of the *Kula* system, you have to realize the totality of the universe in one party. Take one particle of anything which exists in this world. That one particle is to be realize the totality of the whole universe. The totality, totality energy is found one particle. Everything is full of one thing and one thing is full of all things. 

And, this, of course summarizes the whole central idea of the traditional Shaiva *Saṃpradāya*. Which is very much a *Kula*, *Kula* consciousness, Shaiva *Saṃpradāya*. This what it says here. 

Now, in this verse which as I have already said, enough of this explanation of just the first verse only. And, now, the question of Devi continues in one and a half verses. In the translation page 53. And in the Sanskrit page 54. As it is obvious from the very first part of the question, the Devi knows, the Devi knows, and then what is she aiming at? It comes clear in the second verse. And, that she knows is very clear that one sentence. It that *guhyaṃ mahāguhyaṃ gatayasya mahāpadaṃ*. See, even if if you are a very advanced disciple, still, you should go to your *Guru*. She is the most advanced disciple, but still she, she says Devi knows this secret, this great secret. Now, this is the ingenuity of Tantric exegesis, that why why should she repeat *mahāguhyaṃ*? The *guhyaṃ* is already there. Because, it has a double meaning, *mahā-aguhyaṃ*. And this is the whole, uh, the secrecy of the Tantras and their complete clarity. They, they are simultaneous. And, it depends on the capacity of the disciple, the purity. Because, it is also said that the disciple must be purified by all sorts of descent of grace. And, then only, you can realize that it is actually *apuguhyaṃ*. It is not hidden. But, for those who are not ready with this secret, it is secret. So, 

She And of course And this interpretation is played with this double meaning of the Here and then with the whole uh Maha as we shall see then this great secret of the great non secret in Lord Now we just see the beginning of the a mention This is a secret mystery because it is not being evident but it is only by in and in which the essential nature remains unknown It is not evident Moreover it is largely an within the kingdom but it is known to everyone as the source of creation So this is the universality of the Tantric revelation or though this so to say only for the initiated and only for the healing the whole spiritual world actually But this is what they say it is not that kind of esoteric reality but the same reality is that is known to everyone Only of course the difference may be that it is not recognized that that is why we recognize this But it is known to everyone that whenever they cannot drive a a this beautiful toward the end of us not the beginning This is even the the simple villager they know it Everybody knows it And therefore Going to the other extreme order and bringing from the the *Atma* mind that they know it They know this answer They know this because they cannot leave that Because one of the definitions of *Anuttara* is precisely life Karma So who doesn't live Or if you are not aware that is doubtful But it is definitely known to everyone This consciousness is everybody Now Now what those in the its ultimate analysis if it is the consciousness should be the *Atma* itself What writes and divides in the different states of knowing knowledge and knowing the objects objects Now should be the *Atma* is should be the *Atma* If you under I suppose everybody is familiar with the 36 tattvas And the difference that Maya is there but not the individual Maya Maya is one of the uh Tattvas and when Maya Maya is not of just illusion Maya is the same power of the Lord in her hidden in the hidden But when the Maya gets transformed that is the the quantum leap in the Tattvas It is that from Maya to It has the same power the same energy which is Maya at the lower level becomes at the pure level and that means a pure wisdom pure knowledge etc But it is nothing but is two two parts of the same thing The Maya of the Lord is part and the should be the *Atma* is the the same power And then he goes the because they are in a *Trikona* And you have both in the book and in my book the story of the manifestation of the *Trikona* which I have given with illustrations the relationship from *Atma Paramatma* and Maya Shiva Shakti and and It Shakti and the So this is what it describes Now this triangular which we find in the text In my book it is the relationship of the the  चित् चिदानन्दरूपेण शांतिमयश्चित् चिदानन्दरूपेण परमात्मनोऽनुप्रवेशः शांतिरूपत्वम्। आत्माविमर्शशांतिरूपत्वम्। आत्माविमर्शशांतिरूपत्वम्। of the nature of repose in the the reflection of the self-consciousness  पराशश्य शक्तिः स्वभावं विकल्पितां विकल्पाख्यया परापरावाङ्मन्त्रावीयर्यैश्चतुर्द्धा। परापरावाङ्मन्त्रावीयर्यैश्चतुर्द्धा। Now he is He takes the question of the Devi as a as a Hindu would say *Bahana* as an excuse to elaborate on *Aham* and *Maha* because of *Maha Maha* In other words this uninterrupted power of consciousness indicated by a or manifestation of manifestation of the life in the form of the energy of the 


natural innate mantra known as the Vāc is *Ahaṁ* This is consistently found in the Śivaite Utpaladeva's *Ājñāpramātrasiddhi* *Takṣaś cit ātmā viśānte ahaṁ āvo iti ge getam* This is a very frequently verse by Utpaladeva's *Ājñāpramātrasiddhi ahaṁ āva* the I-consciousness pure I-consciousness is consistent state of repose in itself of light the of the nature of light *Ākāśa ākāśaś cit ātmā viśānte ahaṁ āvo iti ge getam* So that is to to bring about this I this *Ahaṁ* that it is not an individual identity but it is that all-pervasive consciousness And that *viśānti* So if So that's why the translation into uh any Western language is so dangerous because they associate with I always the individual and here it is the universal light So this this makes a whole difficulty in translating and understanding because this *viśānti* You cannot get it in your limited uh ego uh which is full of the *saṁskāras* and *malas* and so on that there is no *viśānti* There is uh total restlessness But that *viśānti* you can only get it when you are in that supreme I-consciousness which is of the nature of light Light in the Supreme light across the So the *ākāśasya ātma viśānti ahaṁ āvo iti* And yeah I don't want to go into this philosophical discussion otherwise we cannot proceed with it with the text because how this *Aham* became so important in the system and not *Ātman* later in Vedānta But this is a very good discussion to relate *Ahaṁ* to the *viṣaya kārikā* in some other context The real I feeling is that in which in the process of enjoyment all external objects lack the charm although they are intended to induce enjoyment from their manifoldness come to rest and finally repose in their essential uncontracted unutterable aspect And this unutterable aspect is the real *Ahaṁ āva* So here definitely the I-consciousness is the divine the ultimate I-consciousness And this is the secret of great mystery In the process of expansion the changeless unsurpassable eternal repose which then later is the of the form A which is the natural primal sound The life of the entire range of letters energies *saṁkalpa kalā jāgrat jñāna jīvanabhūta* Here in the process of expansion yesterday we have talked about A the not only the symbol of *Anuttara* but the beginning of the whole manifestation of language not only in Sanskrit but in so many other languages Here in the process of expansion it assume assumes the Ha form symbol of Śakti For expansion this other aspect of the form of Ha And this is a here it has a double meaning of the linguistic the uh expiration and of the emission So *Ahaṁ Ha* that is Kundalinī Śakti and then it expands into a dot symbolizing objective phenomena *nādo bindurūpaḥ na* and indicative of the identity of the entire expansion of Śakti with Haṁ So here he construes *Ahaṁ Ha ma ahaṁ* as representative of Śiva-Śakti-*nāda* And then by the way this Then text page 289 that I have translated this stotra fragments sometimes it's not stotra but I don't say precisely in him and then he puts just one word or two words it but they're so rich their images also poetically and mystically So in uh here he says that *Uktā mayā eva stotram iti* This is from text 22 text page 20 *yaṁ na kiṁ canā mameti dīnānāṁ ātmā viśānti cara cara jantor bodhitaṁ satvabhū niśaṁ yaṁ na kiṁ canam ātmani sarvaṁ sarvaṁ iti mukhe put uttarāṁ tvaṁ upe upevā āha uttarāṁ tvaṁ upevā ātmā* No no this is this is again a mistake in the I'm sorry One *Ahaṁ* One *Ahaṁ* And uh this verse evokes into a complex of *nama nama* mine So this my 

It can be something possessive or just a juxtaposition. The thought nothing is mine makes insentient beings miserable. Couldn't put in the other form happily Nothing is mine makes insentient beings miserable. But the same thought nothing is mine means to me I am everything. That's why I have obtained the knowledge. This is so beautiful that the same thing that's where and a a a maybe a psychologist can say also the same thing which causes depression in one person is a cause of happiness in another. Nothing is mine. It I mean, *Sannyāsi* or liberated being he doesn't own anything, but he is so happy. He's free. Nothing is mine. Because it means I am everything. But this is only when we come to that word  so that satisfaction because the main trouble of people especially in the the the more developed people is that dissatisfaction. And yeah, but this  honor another. This this this we have seen honor another. This *abhūlanātha* Thinking that I'm not clever, I'm not beautiful, I I'm missing so many things and and the other people are much more uh intelligent or richer, more beautiful, and and just wonderful. And so, so this *abhūlanātha* But this is another honor. This is the feeling that I don't have it yet. But the same thought in the in the enlightened being means I am everything. So I don't need anything. Because this is that fullness is already there. There is nothing to wish. It also relates very well to emptiness in Buddhism. *Śūnyatā*. The way it is translated. Uh, yes. Something I've to do. Uh Yeah. He he analyzes them on on a possessive pronoun.  Buddhism is it The house some very still beautiful in the in this fourth chapter. At the end of the commentary on this beach 58 in the translation And on page 57 Very interesting how to uh *adbhutam parameśvaro hi bhagavān ādi-vyavahāre'pi paraśaktimaya eva sarvatra adbhuta- rūpatvāt*. And this translation. Being He's only light itself. And here's a different text in translation. Because Now we come to the second part of the question of the Devi. Maybe we can recite it as we have done already many times. Second verse. *Hṛdaya- sthā tu yā śaktiḥ* Second verse. Page 20 in the Sanskrit text or 19 in the translation also. 

Now here we come to it's difficult to see this central words because there are many central words in the text. But one which is really absolutely central is the **heart**. And why yesterday we were talking about *jñānīs* and *mokṣa* And we said this of the power moving into the space of consciousness It is really the power moving in the space of the **heart**. And that is why it causes the **heart** and this is right from Chāndogya Upaniṣad, the space of the **heart** is as vast as the universe. And the whole space is contained in it. And that freedom to move is freedom to move in the space of the **heart**. Now, in the In every Upaniṣad there's list of of occurrences of the their petiole forty in uh different different levels of meaning. Uh, and **heart** that's why **heart** is one of the consequences in for because it comprises from the physical to the mystical and to the universal from individual to the universal. That comprises all these levels. And even from the tantra itself sometimes uh in in Abhinavagupta has uh added something or has expanded something which is not so much in the tantric text. But here it is definitely faithful to the tantric background. It gives so much importance to the **heart**. And uh, you can have a look at this table where it occurs because it occurs first in the second part of the question of Devi. And then immediately in the first verse of the answer of *parameśvara*. *Parameśvara* immediately speaks of this space of this space of the **heart**. 

*Hṛdaya- sthā tu yā śaktiḥ Kauliki-kulanāyikā tāṃ me kathaya devesha yena tṛptim labhāmyaham*. 

Now, here we come to *Kauliki-kulanāyikā*. That clearly shows that she already knows. She knows part Still she requests him to reveal this to her *Kauliki kula nayika*. Why? *yena tṛptim labhāmyaham*. By which I obtain full satisfaction. So, I think if you remember we can remember that there was so it is not a question of knowing more, because she already knows it. But this knowledge should lead to satisfaction, to fullness, to uh fulfillment. 

*Tṛpti* And as I said it is really tantric because it it reaches from the food to sex, to uh all levels of satisfaction and fulfillment. Up to the highest mystical. So that is connecting. And this is precisely uh phenomena of *kula*. Of *Kaula*. They're all the levels are included in it. It's not the detached happiness. But it is all inclusive uh uh that *tṛpti* is especially in Viṣṇu Kramati, they already say it in *śāstra*, the finding repose uh which is of course, the end of dissatisfaction. But, uh the tantras The both because honor everyone, and this is very important. And they she got this special *tṛpti* that Devi she says from which through which I get full satisfaction. And then at the end of the Gaṇapati, at the end of Paratṛśikā, there's no such dramatic ending. Ending is only in the in the Uttara Amnaya. But uh, at the end of the Gaṇapati is now I am fully satisfied. So, I have nothing more to wish. And she embraces him. She uh uh she comes one with him. That *tṛpti* is fully achieved through but through the practice of all these under 12 *bhāvanās*. And uh, at least one of them is fully And then only she has that fulfillment, satisfaction. So, first first line she states what is already there. *Hṛdaya- sthā tu yā śaktiḥ kauliki-kulanāyikā*. And this dedication of *Kula Kaula*, it shows that's why it repeats on which is a very delicate and simple explanation of *Kula*. *Kauliki* situated in the first verse. And here begins with *tṛpti*. *Kauliki* That energy that power who dwells in the heart. Who Who's abode is in the heart of the *sādhaka*. Who is *Kauliki-kulanāyikā*? Who is Well, I mean, he's in his translation Tell me about that *Kauliki śakti* who resides in the heart. The *śakti* who is the chief source of the entire manifestation. And who is the presiding deity of all manifestation? This is *Kula nāyikā* in translation. I think this sentence is wrong. Who leads the entirety of *Kula*. *Tāṃ me kathaya devesha yena tṛptim labhāmyaham.* Tell me. Reveal to me so that I may have full satisfaction. *Tṛpti*. 

Now Yeah. This commentary then 161. 

*Vitjastā kukṣitā se ah*, the *vacanā* analysis splitting the word with *ātmā sparśāt* is the Supreme conscious base of all objective experiences, like blue, et cetera. And subjective experiences, like pleasure, et cetera. So, the **heart** is whether this with sat, that aboard of vehicles that *Viśvanātha* raises visual. But is not here because it will come later on. And also, of the empirical experiences conditioned by the body, *prāṇa*, and *indriya*. *Ātmā* means knowledge of manifold varied objects, like jar, cloth, et cetera. Brought about by its own freedom. *Sparśāt* means the scintillating *śakti*, abiding in the So, *Vitjastā* means the scintillating energy abiding in the knowledge of varied objects, brought about by the Supreme conscious base of all objective and subjective experience and experience by its own freedom. I see this answer. *Sann sthite viśvan tu van*. I got you. Expresses here is precisely that *hṛdaya* is and that's what *pratyabhijñā* and cima mama *antaryāmi*, this base of my **heart**, and that space, the infinite capacity. Everything is contained in it. Aha. All objective and subjective and ah, the traditional way of saying objective is blue and subjective is sugar pleasure. So, blue, when see look at the blue sky, is outside and pleasure is a subjective feeling. So, both the objective and subjective realities are contained in that vastness of the **heart**. So, the **heart** is inclusive. Inclusiveness and vastness. What is this, ah, the scintillating is a translation of *Spandanāmai, Spandanāmai Spandanā* Passion. Then he interprets *kulanāyakā*. So, Śiva is the leader of all the *śaktis*, also the leader of the whole universal controlling it, which actually because the whole universe is nothing but manifestation of *śakti*. So, *kulan* in that inclusive sense, including the body, *prāṇa* and the *indriya*, et cetera. *Kaulikī* This one. *Guru* to immanentize all manifestation is precisely what *Kula* The vastness of *kulanāyakaulikī*. Precisely what the *Kula* and *Akula apara deīnāyakī* and *Kula* is Śiva and *Kulaśakti Kaulikī*. So, The union of *Akula* and *Kula*. For one who abides in *Kula*, but is *Akula* is *Kaula*. That is Śiva. Being who is *Kaula* or Śiva abides in identical form as *Kaulikī*. Is very important because, ah, the unity of Śiva and *Śakti* is implied in this analogy. The entire range of manifestation, *Kula*, abides within the *sakti* because it is included in the life of *Akula*, that is Śiva. And therefore, the quotes Spanda Kārikā, is very beautiful. A bit of art about this verse and I don't have the text here. But those of you who have studied Spanda Kārikā can remember that it's only by by a touch of the power of the self, *ātmā sparśāt* by coming in contact with the power of the self that the realization occurs. *Ātmā sparśāt*. *Tathā deīnāthīśvara* resorting to that power, that divinity is manifested together with the secret formula. That is, the indicators being endowed with the power of omniscience, proceed to carry out their assigned functions towards their embodied forms, just as the senses of their embodied forms are resorting to the power of *spanda*, proceed to carry out their specific functions. Now, this is a quotation from Spanda Kārikā, which is very important because that inclusiveness of *Kaulikī* includes the senses. *Karaṇa, karaṇāni*. And then there is a *śloka śīghreśas*, Lord of Lords, oh Lord of the Gods, *śīghreśa*. The force at this. Mm, *śīghreśa*. Pleasure, Lord of Lords, and *śīghreśa*, et cetera. And this is interesting because, uh, of the consciousness, this is for scholars. The consciousness that these authors have of various varied versions. So, he says that Somananda, he has a variant. Instead of *tāṃ*, it is *taṃ*. Instead of *tāṃ yathā*, he read the variant Somananda Somananda's commentary, instead of *tāṃ yathā*, and his phrase, therefore, for it may mean then that the *vitja* may indeed, the satisfaction of the highest bliss. That is, I may enjoy the freedom derived from the bliss of the highest mountains. This is a beautiful quotation from, uh, Somananda, the bliss of the highest mountains. *Paraānandam aham labhe, paramātmā svayaṃ vibhūti svātantrya lakṣaṇ, bhavāmi, iti Samanvayaḥ*. So, this is his interpretation of Somananda. There is also another reading by Jayaratha instead of *labhāmi*. So, there are several variants that Abhinavagupta was fully conscious that there are variants in the text itself. And Abhinavagupta adopted this reading, *labhāmi*. The different, uh, versions. By the word *aham, labhāmi, aham*, this should be understood, the life and soul of worldly experience. So, this is very clear from this verse. He says, "This *Pāśa* is the universal life, and not the energy in its individual. Having understood that the teaching, the nature of highest described contains the satisfaction of knowing oneself as the divine, the satisfaction of complete i-consciousness. And this is the only way where this *viśva śakti* or this, where you can rest. We don't really run after, but what we are running after is always about, trying to be what What our being What is searching is always that once we attain the complete i-consciousness, there's complete satisfaction.  And page 21. At least I we have put down this verse at the very beginning. There he says the purpose of composing his commentary, that we have done already in the introduction itself. So, no need to repeat. And now, finally, after the lady has asked a question to him and author says, "Finally, *Haivara*." *Haivara, vacanāt*. Of course But, I still would like to remind you of those words because it's so beautiful. That those are because the word *sphūrti*, she connects with those who are thirsting for the Śivā *rasa*. Śivā *rasa Sparśam īśānti pāśa*, the *mānasam satatam aśivatvaṃ śaktaṃ śivena niścitam. Vitjā yatra bhavati diśte śān vidhārayed, yathā trika teśu, taṃ*. So, I think you remember. Begin. Those who are thirsting for this Śivā *rasa*. And that Śivā *rasa* is gated, it destroys all *aśiva*, all inauspiciousness, all And to dissolving the knot, which is in the life in the space of the **heart**. So, I commented this verse was very useful in the beginning, but here it is fitting because *hṛdayastā*. *Kulaśakti*. And unless that knot is removed, then that freedom of that chit can not move in that. *Pretyabhijñā*, which Pradhava is talking. See. And then we have already discussed it. That first three *hṛdaya vacanāt*, which when do in the sense that. And he says for the benefit of *Uvāca*, what he has explained in the days of the lady, applies also here. *Uvāca* might not only means past, nor does it mean the third person. Somebody else is called pradhava or somebody is called something. But it is not you who alone pray the Lord. And the pastness is also, uh, brought to the present. So, the past and the past tense is here so that he brings them. What is he use of repeating and so he says, *uktī che*. Pradhava is talking. Thus, then, they said over the words and here it is. So, *prati vacanāt* of pradhava, but this is the analysis of the name. I don't want There's so many, uh, pages and pages of all the analysis of ah, different interpretations of the name. And if one is to go on, then they might require at least 16 pages of the book only on the name pradhava. From different sources. So, this is only one
