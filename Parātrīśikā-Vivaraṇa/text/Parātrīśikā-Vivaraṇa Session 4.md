Welcome back. I would like you to take the list of ślokas for recitation because, so far, we have followed only… But we are reciting before we… this also śiva śivatattvaśivadṛṣṭiḥ śivadṛṣṭiḥ but so those who have not noticed it before, then they… the concept from the text, śiva śivatattva mahātattvacaitanyaṃ mahātattvacaitanyaṃ and which is full of propositions from the… certain rituals and these things. So, this is a very important thing… the propositions… they love to study them. So, they can be recited… uh… viśrāntiḥ paramā devi kālopatthivitarjitā sarvakalpā vikalpānāṃ sarvāsāṃ saṃvidālayaḥ viśrāntiḥ paramā devi kālopatthivitarjitā sarvakalpā vikalpānāṃ sarvāsāṃ saṃvidālayaḥ 

They refer to the verses viśrāntiḥ paramā devi kālopatthivitarjitā sarvakalpā vikalpānāṃ sarvāsāṃ saṃvidālayaḥ. That should mention, thankfully, that this manuscript and the… who has composed all these verses? I think she was inspired and then these compositions… There are, of course, traditional Kashmiri tunes of recitation which have been sometimes done. But not just verses are composed there… Now, since we have recited these verses tomorrow for the… and there was no meaning given, I would like to start first with these verses and then translation of these verses. So, that we can connect with uh… text we have recited. And actually uh… recite sometimes… after the certain section is concluded, then we give sometimes concluding verses or uh… summary verses of what has gone before. This is… this I don't remember this. But probably this is the kind of summary of what has come before. So, it doesn't matter if you take it now because it concerns the whole section which we are now studying. I… I was sure that I made my own translation that I was disappointed that…  I don't have it. So, it is already there. 

Who has not done it in a poetic form? But they are so poetic, and you would like to stick to it in the poetic way. And the translation is page 63-64 in your book. And…  you can see the…  the… the Sanskrit is on page 22. What I did not mention because uh… this is not the chronology seminar, there are many verses in Prakrit. They are also kind of summary verses. But it is in such a difficult language that even the best scholars could not uh… understand completely.  Actually, this is an interesting phenomena because, actually, the Sanskrit authors, they… they… Prakrit because of the trance… Uh, when it comes to the… the popular religiosity, women speak Prakrit or simple folk, they speak Prakrit. And it's supposed to be a bridge to the people who don't know Sanskrit. But now in the present situation that we know the Sanskrit and we don't know the Prakrit, that it's very interesting. Because Sanskrit is something which has remained continuous. But that kind of Prakrit has been lost. So, we have created it but without…  giving the meaning. Uh, at the end of the Tantrasara, chapters also… now this Prakrit… uh… some kind of verses, but they… equally sometimes they are very close to the Sanskrit, and you can make out. But, otherwise, it's very difficult to understand. So, Sanskrit is the… is a continuity of…  meaning, of scholarship, of… uh… that has not been broken. There is a Prakrit. They… they are not in this… continues, but not English. So, the same also at the end of this Parāprati, there's some Prakrit verses. They are just there for the sake of being there, not without any translation… 

So, the translation on page 63, last uh… two paragraphs till the end of the page. **The divine supreme consciousness power, not different from Śiva though on the point of expansion. According to her essential nature, is said to be jñānaśakti. jñānaśakti vyukta vyavasayātmikā, really not separate from Śiva.** The essential… **The actual expression is jñānaśakti as you on separate apara or pasyanti form and kriyāśakti, the apara or material form.** Now, because this uh… these verses concern the dialogue for both the root chakra… Now, they inquired about the nature of the rajasakti, which expands in the form of the universe, is said to be personal creation. But this is the interesting thing that… that the Devi herself, she is not only the… the questioner, but she is a self-questioning essence. 

Yeah. The Śiva has said that with one jñānaśakti ādi rūpataḥ parāparābheda rūpa paśyantyādi vaktṛtve… There are several words, paśyanti, because it refers to the different levels of consciousness. Now inquired about the nature of rajasakti, which expands in the form of the universe. Is said to be personal question. *The Devi who is that very śakti is the initiator of the questions about her.* So, she ask about her own self. That we come to that point. Your question is not very complete. Because there is another one verse on behalf of her question before the answer came. And uh… then I think maybe because the first verse, the question concerns Śiva and the second concerns Shakti. The consideration of the nature of this expansion is said to be the most excellent form of speech concerning Śiva's supreme power. That very utterance which constitutes the return movement pertaining to absorption beginning with maṃ. That is a jīva who has limited consciousness reaching the full inner śakti, her, and finally getting absorbed in the compact mass of bliss of the highest consciousness and uttarāvakāra uttarāvakāra the trance. There's a bit Ghana and then the saṃhāra karanamayaḥ. Śaiva in whom the entire expansion of the universe is involved in what he abides as the perpetual responder. Perpetual responder. So, he… she is a perpetual questioner, and he's a perpetual responder. It is not just an ordinary thing of the revolution, but this is an ongoing… This is the beauty: because the dynamism of the Divine, and dynamism of the relationship of śakti and Śiva, is the dynamism which is constantly moving. So, that it's not that once the world is started several billion… uh… God knows how long we go, and then it is finished. But this process of relationship, in a way, is continuously going on, and it's very important not to put them limitation there. Parāprati in whom the entire expansion of the universe is involved in what he abides is the perpetual responder. As the dual process of expansion and retraction is beyond time, therefore, this question answer is continuous. That is of uniform nature. 

This is uh… paraṣaṁvād associated with the Māṇḍūkya… uh… has already explained the recipe in the form of trikaśāstra. Now, this uh… paraṣaṁvād, the supreme relationship between uh… cidānanda śakti and… which is of the nature of question and answer. So, this dialogue… this goes on continuously, unperturbed by love… ṣa ṣaḍartha-sāgara-saṁgrahaḥ… Who are the…? Plural refers to this guru-śiṣya-paramparā who has uh… initiated it and who has uh… given enlightenment in trika and in kula… ṣaḍartha half of six, so it's tri-trika. So, here you have a kind of summary of this uh… dialogue process, which is ongoing and which is that uh… the very nature of the Supreme uh… consciousness is… is not… it's not a one-way traffic. It's never a one-way traffic. And that is why revelation without a partner, without a dialogue, is not a revelation. It is uh… given to… it is a relationship, paraṣaṁvād. And, from that paraṣaṁvād, all the other relationships are derived. They come down from that Supreme consciousness… So, we will repeat this uh… citation, but now at least you have some idea of the context and uh… We'll come to… tomorrow we'll repeat this portion. 

Now, we have been in the middle of uh… the interpretation of mantra… and of this sixteen meanings… We have come to… seven… seven…? Okay… Yeah. And he quotes his own stotra, this beautiful, very subtle imagery of the rain… which illustrates uh… the subtleness of the presence of God, subtleness of the Divine essence, which is… can only be perceived in relation to something. Otherwise, it is so all-pervasive that we don't perceive it. And that relation to something is, of course, whatever they do, whether it's ritual or meditation or uh… relationships of any kind. In that, this saṁvāda becomes uh… tangible, or the presence of the… of God becomes tangible. But, not in itself, it is so subtle that we are not able to perceive it. But I just… I… I'm just reminded of, of course, the saints and the jñānabhaktas, they have that subtle to perceive it. And I'm reminded of a story of this… I… I don't know whether you've heard of an… a devotee of Bhagavān Rām. He was said akhurit… very famous akhurit uh… guru in Benares. And he had his enlightenment when he was quite young. He was quite young. He was alone in a jungle somewhere, and such powerful experience, and he just… he described it to one of his disciples, and then he has written biography. They say for four days… I don't know whether, exactly, it was four days… He was under the impact of the enlightenment, and he did not dare to move. And why? Because he felt that, by moving, he is offending the air and the… all the beings who were around him. And you know this kind of intruding into uh… something which we don't perceive otherwise, as if he would do violence to even to the air around him. So, this kind of total subtlety of uh… perception… that is what I find very difficult… He's having… Otherwise, we are constantly violating uh… the elements and the animals and everything. Of course, the Jainas, they have the uh… strict rule about non-violence and so on. But to have that sensitivity of the… the… this sickness… And uh… that requires a lot of training, experience, sensitivity, and so on. So, that the simile of that uh… tender rain uh… uh… indicates that subtlety. 

Now we come to meaning number eight… Yeah, and therefore in the meanings uh… what he questions… what Abhinavagupta questions are hierarchies of all kinds. And uh… because *amum manaḥ* is the negation of anything else or anything higher, anything other. And that means negation of the hierarchy… different hierarchies. So, in the uh… meaning number eight, he also questions the hierarchy of the upāya. You know, the four upāyas: śāṁbhava-śāṁbha- śākta and āṇavopāya. Although āṇavopāya cannot be counted, actually, in any comparison… Āṇavopāya is not uh… by the very negation again. It is… cannot be compared with anything. But uh… the three upāyas which are clearly graded… So, what is… is here that śāktopāya is said to be higher than mantra… āṇavopāya… śāṁbhavopaya is higher than the mantra… Even in śāṁbhavopaya there is a hierarchy among themselves in the form of pūta-tattva-mantreśvara, etcetera, etcetera. So, these are uh… the vessel beings of uh… subjects. Again, even among physical elements, there are all kinds of hierarchies, not only the upāyas… Among physical elements, there's a hierarchy in the form that the Earth is lower than the water is higher and so on. Space is the highest uh… of the tattvas, of the bhūtas. And then, in the case of the mental states… uh… states of consciousness, where the waking state, the dreaming state, the deep sleep state, and the turīya… They're again graded… a graded hierarchy. And turīya is the highest, etcetera. So, the dreaming is higher than the waking… sleep is higher than that… the fourth state, turīya, is higher than that… The state beyond the fourth turīya, the citta, is higher than that… than the turīya… Even in the waking condition, because Abhinavagupta, in other context, there are subdivisions among the states of consciousness. There is uh… uh… grade in waking and uh… and so on, and so on. So, there are subdivisions among this, not just one waking. There is uh… uh… deep sleep in… in waking, etcetera… Also… Yeah, this subdivisions also… Even in the waking condition, there's a hierarchy of these states among themselves to four-fold varieties. I have conclusively discussed this, my friend, in the śrī-bhāva-pañcikā… Unfortunately, this is a text which has been lost because, several times, he himself refers to this śrī-bhāva-pañcikā, which is a commentary on Māṇḍūkya-kārikā and uh… as far as one has… scholars have found that is lost. In case you find any manuscript in your uh… uh… collection, where the śrī-bhāva-pañcikā is very important text because he often refers… I… not this particular instance, because that is a separate… no use of… that was… See often… Abhinavagupta corrects himself that "I've quoted too much detail, and then it… needlessly delaying for the hearers and readers… It will only unnecessarily increase the volume of the book. It's already big enough." This kind of uttaratva hierarchy only shows higher and lower and contains the delusion of duality. That's uh… the reason why he negates these hierarchies, because con- considering something low and something high, obviously, leads to illness… So, in anuttara there is no such gradation or such hierarchy… 

Then meaning number nine… This hierarchical sense of inferiority and superiority applies, practically, in the social realm of the caste, to the caste system. This is very important. Because, in the context of this uh… social context… not only thousand years ago, even now, which has not… is not ended yet… So, uttara… uttara and anuttara is used in an abstract sense… sense in which there is no indication of superiority or inferiority as in the division of varṇa- brāhmaṇa-kṣatriya-vaiśya-śūdra, etcetera. The lowest caste. And in another place he says uh… that this division of the caste system… It is uh… and there's a very humoristic way of describing it… uh… ridiculous… So, here in the context of anuttara, of course, the superiority and inferiority of social classes or caste, it doesn't make any sense. It is here very brief, but in other places he is very explicit about it… very explicit… 

Now, the meanings 10, 11, and 12… They refer to different groups of śaktis… Now uh… which are also in a hierarchical order… However, it doesn't go into detail, but… the hierarchy of energies as uttara and anuttara being beyond uh… being free from such hierarchies. Such is even praśna-vimṛṣana-vaicārikī, although he hasn't explicitly spoken about… even that is a hierarchy which is to be overcome… Akhurā akhurā akhurā paraḥ paraḥ paraḥ paraḥ… It is all uh… very central concept of trika. But, in the light of anuttara, all these hierarchies are to be negated or relativized.

Now meaning 13… It is divided… Yes, 13 relates to initiation. And… 

The direct root, not to offend para crossing, suggesting way beyond the worldly existence through imposition by the process of initiation. He gives a concise description of what happens in initiation. And this is something very characteristic, very concise… the… what happens in initiation, because it's a basic… very basic uh… feature of any Shaiva tradition. The Guru sets in motion his own consciousness in the consciousness of the disciple. Actually, it's a very beautiful description of what happens. Thus he applies an initiation which is intended to bring about liberation, mukti, by means of the process of the central point, viśuddha, which is devoid of the movement of prāṇa and apāna, which assumed the address of concert. And is the junction of both prāṇa and apāna. And by the difference of prāṇa of the miśrakaula sakaula sakaula miśrakaul initiation… these we are not going into the details here. And through the practice of eugenical initiation, the case of the last breath of the complete liberation. 

Now, especially the beginning of… it's very beautiful, the… the guru sets in motion the consciousness… his own consciousness in the consciousness of the disciple. What I said about this *aham* and the example of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, you know, that the Guru has the capacity to connect directly with… with the consciousness of the disciple. And uh… so, this is actually a very beautiful description. But now, in all this, how is this kind of mockery made of this unsurpassable consciousness, *anuttarāceta*, which is self-luminous, omnipresent, unmodified, unrestricted, and the imitation of space, time for so very iconoclastic way of uh… criticizing what happens in initiation. Therefore, anuttara is that in which the crossing over does not occur by such imposition. 

As we have seen in this initiation, that gives mukti… liberation is achieved only in the case of one who knows the truth, the reality. It's here towards the pratiṣṭhā itself. We are not going into details. It is in page uh… 424. 23 and 24. Verse 26 of the pratiṣṭhā and, certainly, the tantra itself. By reciting, you could get something. We are not going into all these details because we are not concerned with the ritual. And we have no time for that. But tantra is very ritualistic. There's a lot of rituals. The important verses, as I said, which inspired Abhinavagupta are these beginning verses, on which are totally at the level of the highest. Yeah. But then, comes down to the ritual. But there are a few verses in… even in the ritual section, which also allow him to transcend. One is that prāṇadīkṣā, what it says here. And the other, which is always quoted by uh… Kashmir Shaivites for… for criticizing ritual, for the spirit of overcoming, transcending ritual.  At least, the mantraśakti, but they only lead to that… address the mantraśakti, because they… in their complete ritualistic procedure. The mantra is made and uh… uh… the whole process, you know, just the… is explained for the… and he has to… to see that mantra then, and then the flowers thrown and all these things are… but that tablet itself… address the mantraśakti, even without these ceremony. Which is uh… overcoming ritual. You don't need mantra. Which is, actually, the Kashmir Shaiva tradition is happening up to now. These kind of external ritualistic procedure have practically disappeared. Mantraśakti, I have not seen anybody making mantraśakti and… but it starts already from the temple. Even without seeing the mantra, but the same transmission takes place. So, here we have the two aspects: the importance of the dīkṣā and also its overcoming. Overcoming especially of the external manifestation, external rituals. 

Now, 14 and 15, completely different. So far, *anuttara* awareness lays stress on the negative prefix *an*. So, negation, negative hierarchy, negative uh… all kinds of conceptions. But, in 14, it comes to positive uh… meaning. This uh… the entire definition is centered on life that comes from… But, of course, with some ingenious uh… grammatical analysis, he comes to the definition of anuttara from *an*, and the root *an*… to breathe and to eat. With critics of suffix… suffix means to breathe. Thus, *an* means an "anu" of the empirical individual's life consisting in breath and who considers his gross body or the subtle body… a temple… that is prāṇa as itself. Similarly, anna and life, prāṇa… prāṇa existing in the body consisting of different powers, devoid of right consciousness, as in the case of one who is known as śūnyapramātṛ. Now, this is… these are levels of subjects, levels of consciousness of subjects, the seven pramātṛs. I think most of you are familiar. Śūnyapramātṛ is the experience of the void. So, anuttara would mean superiority over the empirical individual, śūnyapramātṛ having preponderance over everything, because of its being the highest truth, because of its being that of himself. And this world full of sentient and insentient existences, the non-sentient ones exist because of their dependence on the sentient ones. The life of all living beings consists indeed in the aforementioned divine powers of knowledge and action. In the case of other experience also, as in one's own only the bodies, etcetera, appear as different. This is a… Sometimes, Abhinavagupta gives powerful sentences, which sometimes escape. It's up to the interpreter. *Only the bodies appear as different. And that which is life appears in everyone without any distinction.* This is very… so, that… that denying of hierarchies, denial of higher and lower, the… the denial… it, finally, is positive expression of life, which is *anuttaram*. It is the same in all beings. Okay, that's uh… so we are coming to the… to the end uh… of the six definitions. I think it's worthwhile going through these two last ones. Anuttara maybe analyzed that as a *nut-tara*, meaning the tāratva or flotation of the nut or impulsion of *a*. *A* is the śaktikalā who is above the reigns of māyā, who is not found in śuddhāśuddha, that means in the Vedic tradition. Who is the bliss of the very waveless ocean of consciousness abiding in the natural supreme light, who covers both the initial and the final stage of the perfect high consciousness, *aham*. Which comprehends the entire cosmos, which is the expression of the creative divine of śakti. *Nut-tara* is impulsion… is the culmination of the expansion, this *a*. Now, these are again one of those simple terms of that kalā. Tāratva means the flotation or swimming in that root. That is the continuous of that state over everything else. The sense is that though anuttara, in its expansion, is promoted by śakti and mantra, yet it is never separated by these. It pervades them and everything else. So, the Sanskrit is a *uttara pratiṣṭhām*. You have it in the… at the bottom of page nine. Yes. I'm just, finally, because… out of… for lack of time, I'm not discussing the Sanskrit. But this is so beautiful that the meaning of uh… meaning number 14, where he says *"paratva api hi svat"*… *"Look at the other just as yourself."* They are the very peak here. But only the bodies… 

…appear… This is tremendous… all this divide… being separated… everybody seems to be different. But all the difference is only that. But they are… are in… They are meant for… Close, because close mind… Yeah, the Brahman… but we are the individual… of us… separate. But that is just life. That is undivided state… our… the material… on 16… 16… the final definitions split the word into *Anu Tara*, derived from the root *nut* to impede. We have used this before. *Anu*… this… that… where successive action depending on the duality of going and coming in space or performance happen… This is again overcoming of the multiplicity of space and time. The other meaning takes *anu* as space, ākāśa, and *anu tara* as that which is higher even than ākāśa. The quality of Shiva… *anu*… ākāśa is, of course, in Upanishads… symbol of Brahman. But it is also the space in which activity takes place as well as the medium of… *anu tara* is beyond ākāśa, because what the activity of our consciousness is successionless because of the absence of the relativity of space and time, which are characterized by objectivity and absence of objectivity with God, which is full of the delight… its own consciousness. 

Now, in the Vijñāna Bhairava, this very interesting dharama… What… under… twenty eight other… the copies of today here then… When then dharama that leads to a state from ākāśa to nirākāśa… beyond space… Spacelessness… It's a very subtle idea. In ākāśa also, there may be said to be successive action on account of incidental contact with different objects. In the supreme consciousness, however, which has as its essence the sovereign power of thoroughly uninterrupted absolute freedom, which as high consciousness full of the entire multitudinous objectivity characterized by blissfulness… The condition which is accepted by Shiva but is viewed with hesitancy by an outsider… Shiva at lower level with a feeling of ease characterized by delight and differentiated objectivity… Which in under saṃskāra may obstruct… Yeah. It's the greatest freedom is to be equally at home in the differentiation and objectivity than in the transcendence. That equal delight in differentiated objectivity. In other words, this is something we have to… to avoid in order to be able to… that *anu tara*. But here, even the differentiated objectivity or multiplicity, that which we are always struggling, that also is… and the… the… And the activity of our consciousness is successionless because of the absence of the relativity of space and time, which are characterized by objectivity and absence of objectivity with God. 

Now, this may be a cheap time… you can give us in interpretation… if… words… the term *matsyodari*… Which comes from the matsya, the fish… *matsyodari* is a very official and the… can you explain something… why this simile is used? It's mostly said because there's a spanda. There is a vibration uh… the belly of the fish… I… I'm not familiar with fishes, but… because this… this simile is always given, *matsyodari*… Uh… Can you say why? It… it is a spanda, but what kind…? Vibrate there…? Yeah, it is… yeah, on the movement… vibrate… so the fish is… Successionless… high consciousness is the only one… Successionless in the sense of space and time are overcome. 

Now uh… We don't need to go more into the… this whole discussion. But that… in the 16 meanings of *anu tara* are really one of the extreme examples of the Tantric attitudes is… and not leaving anything out… Not even the social uh… social order, caste, etc… not leaving anything out. So, it's tremendously comprehensive. But Abhinavagupta achieves, by his ingenious methods, this sovereignty… he avoids and negates… this is my… something… avoids and negates all the components: transcendent… immanent… superior… inferior… bondage… liberation, etcetera, all are relativized, but not abolished. That has to be said. It's not abolished. It's not that completely denied. It's only relativized. This is what… under what they call comprehensiveness or what in philosophy or theological concept… Therefore, the hierarchies which are the soil in its… its life breath at different levels and in different realms, from the social to the elementary… the occult powers to the mental, psychic states… of a spark to the order of divine energies to the spiritual paths of intro-liberation, bhoga, etcetera… The very process of spiritual advancement, such as happens in initiation and the stages of the awakening or opening of the chakras in the spiritual ascent… all these becomes meaningless at the level of *anu tara*. So, it is a very powerful questioning of all our uh… concepts of spiritual progress. And that is where I have asked Nancy to recite tomorrow the *anu tara* śloka. That is from this stotra, which is precisely an expression of that experience. The experience of overcoming of all uh… levels of ascendance or the opposite. And, in that way, relativizing all these modes of understanding and experience, *anu tara* is itself the process of liberating it from its projections and identifications. And hence liberating the reader, disciple, who is meditating on these meanings… these interpretations. 

Now we have only done so far the first word of the question of Devi: *Anuttara kataḥ devaḥ satya kaulitāḥ*. Next word is *kataḥ*… How? But he doesn't go very much into this *kataḥ* uh… which definitely… and the presentation… Grammatically, this *kataḥ* can be instrumental case, *kena prakāreṇa*… in what way… that's actually how we expect to… What… in what way can one realize this *anu tara*? Or is it taken in the sense of phenomenally: what is this way? So, the 16 meanings of *anu tara* actually reply to the number of *kataḥ*: What is this *anu tara*? The… so many possible meanings. But *kena prakāreṇa*… in what way do they give this…? But even the understanding of these meanings is tentative. Because the Devi herself says *yena vijñāta mattena*… So, just as also in the Vijñāna Bhairava, the Devi, of course, knows the details. She knows because she knows her own nature. So, she also indicates the… the method, *kena*. Now, *kena* uh… *vijñāta mattena*… by the… here… knowledge, of course, knowledge is not a very good translation of *vijñāna*, because that is not more than… We often begin there with meaning of *vijñāna* is mystical or uh… what you can say… It… mystical inside… So, this *kataḥ*, he doesn't go very much… also in the locative, saptamī vibhakti… In which way is the *anu tara*… liberation? Or in what is supposed to be bondage? So, pratham, as I said, the Devi herself already indicates, *vijñāta*. It is a gnostic process. It is not ritual. Although the tantra itself has a lot of verses on ritual, but the whole direction of Abhinavagupta's… the Devi is… is to transcend ritual in knowledge. 

And now, the next word is *kaulitāḥ*. Take a little breath in between… *anu tara kaulitāḥ*… This compound… The compound word of kaulika siddhi and suffix *vant* means the store or the expression of… of the kaulika tradition, the consciousness… the compound… that which bestows the perfection, siddhi, is there clear from the word itself… *siddhi* is *siddhi*, clear… But meant in the sense of particular siddhis, anima, etcetera, but in the sense of perfection, complete… completeness… okay. So, to give you the background uh… I give you something about the meaning of *kula* and *kaula*, and here I must say that this tantric upanishad, which comes out from the Atharva Veda, is extremely useful because it is… the definitions are based entirely on the texts… on the… And, of course, a lot of it is in French, so we have to translate. 

Now, *kula* is a multi-meaning word and, of course, very significant in tantric texts because this multiple meanings… they are so important to… they cannot be reduced to only one thing. So, *kula* means family… *kula* means energy… *kula* means totality… and uh… and, of course, it has been used uh… specifically also for group of family of energies or Shaktis… Yogini… Yogini kula of the early uh… The meanings in the early Tantras is uh… Yogini kula. But if you have an editing from Yogini tradition uh… The Kularnava Tantra, for example… Now, Mantra ma Shakti kula siddhi… I think the meaning is uh… might come… and Kula… Kaula… tantric tradition is by Abhinavagupta. But uh… this different meanings, they appear over… present… and *kula* also means the body. And what is the common meaning between these different meanings of family… uh… group of Yoginis and the totality… cosmos… body… is that it is some organic uh… totality, which has parts, which is not… not uniform. It's a group. So, family can be something very unified, but still it's a group. And also the group of Yoginis… uh… the family of energies and the body, which is an organic… the unity of several parts which are organically related. Now, this uh… um… formula… or they're given by Abhinavagupta from the book that uh… with a… of Shiva, which is based on the commentary Laghuvṛtti, he translates *kula* as embodied cosmos. And he tries to bring together the cosmos and the body, and I… I don't find the translation very useful, but at least it indicates that the cosmic and the bodily, they are connected in *kula*. And Swamiji Lakshman Joo, he always translates it as a totality. So, it's a totality consisting of organic parts… organically related parts. So, it is a cosmically structured uh… totality. Cosmos is taken as a totality which has a… there's a unity, and there's a diversity within that unity, but in an organic way, not in an artificial way. That's why body, cosmos, family, and so on… all these meanings have to be kept in mind. And uh… of course, *kula*, according to uh… a tradition, as a particular tantra tradition… According to Abhinavagupta is not the highest. For him, the highest is Trika. And yet he quotes uh… uh… I think whether it is his own expression or quotation. He gives *kula* such an importance that he says in Tantrāloka that "the fragrance in the flower… the oil in the sesame seed… the living soul in the body and the taste in water… the *kula* is present in several Shastras with their essence". So, *kula* is given that great importance. As a fragrance in the flower… it's a very beautiful, poetic way of giving *kula* such a great importance. And I understand it in the sense… not as a specific tradition. Because then Vyapini Trika… it was… for him, Trika was the highest of all the philosophies. But here *kula*, he intends what…? That basic essence of the totality, the cosmos and body, and the… and the Shakti… they don't play a role in different ways. So, I think in that sense, *kula* is used here in more general meaning and not as a specific uh… tradition. As a living soul in the body, a taste in water, so *kula* is present in several Shastras with their essence… *sa Shastra* means Tantra… Tantra. Now uh… *kula* may also refer to the Shakti as such or to a group of Shaktis. 

Now, *Kaula*… I'm not going into the difference between *Kaula* as tradition and as this non-dual uh… Vedantic Advaita. But here we have *Kaulika*. *Kaulika* derives from *kula*. Now, *Kaulika*… first we give the meanings, and then we will come to the text, as far as we can come today. *Kaulika* means… of *Kauliki* Shakti, that which belongs to *kula*. And it can be the synonym of *kula*. And *Kaulika*, or rather its equivalent in French, and perhaps also *Kaulika* uh… designates the supreme aspect of the divine energy: *Kaulika* or *Kauliki*. In Tantrāloka… Akula… Now, *Akula* is Shiva, and *Kula* is Shakti. *Akula* means that… the one who transcends the… the multiplicity… of that diversity of the cosmos and all these… but Shiva is *Akula*, and Shakti is *Kula*. Because Shakti is always embracing the cosmos and even the body. So that… that is… Shiva Akula siya. And Shiva as… Shiva as… he… *Kula prakaṭanāśalini*… She… of the God who is beyond the Transcendent. She is the one energy who reveals the *kula*… *Kula prakaṭanāśalini*. *Kauliki sa paraśakti*. And she is the highest energy. *Kauliki Abheda yukto yayā*… Who is inseparable from the God. And Abhinavagupta also says that *Kauliki* is the cosmic emission, that which is pervading the cosmos and the dynamic… dynamically… Cosmic emission of the transcendent Shiva, who is *Akula*. It is above that multiplicity… *Kauliki* Shakti, which is there. And that is very important, but this is uh… the definition of *Kauliki* is possible to participate and to identify oneself with that creative energy of the divinity. And that is what is called *Kaula siddhi*. To participate and identifying oneself with that energy… that is what is… because… I mean, this we know from the beginning of our… that you cannot identify yourself with Shiva unless you do it through Shakti. But this is a very general statement, which is more specific to the Shakti. So, participate and identify. So, that is the *Kaulika siddhi*… dharma is related to that… who is… who is the perfection…? *Kaulika* perfection… Perfection of the totality… uh… of… in which we can participate, in which… with which we can identify. But here… and you don't have Anuttara and all those Anuttara… diversity and six meanings, and so on… but still, it is not a question of participating in… Anuttara is always there. It is always presupposed, whether you… you do it by negation or by affirmation, and so on. But there you actually participate in that power. It is through *Kauliki* Shakti… *Kaulika siddhi* to attain… because what the Devi is asking for… two things… *Kaulika siddhi*, and then, eventually, this is uh… the whole way of the entire Tantra. So, *Kaulika*… participate and identify with the *Kaulika*… the perfection of *Kauliki* Shakti. This… I think maybe you are already too tired. So, we make a break to… to the stupefied account, and then we come to that. Thank you. 

In my book, it's page seventy-nine following uh… the translation, page thirty-one. Now, if you take usus Anuttara… Most of the definitions are negations. But, in case of *Kauliki Kaulika siddhi*, it is affirmation. Because she is the totality. And that is the complementarity of the Absolute and its manifestation in the energy. So, that's why, here, at the beginning of the interpretation, he says *kula* is cross… Sthula sukshma… and material… material… or supreme… Para… Prana, life breath… Indriyas, senses… Bhūtādi, the five gross physical elements, both in the collective sense and in the sense of grossness. So, he is all affirmation to all these levels are contained in *Kula* or the quality Shakti. So, *Kula*, or totality, is so-called God, because consciousness itself abides in the various forms of objectivity. So, here we are not philosophical. He is in all forms of the Jagat prasara by means of coagulation. Now, coagulation is a… the… the ajñāna. And here we come to the… the… the understanding of the material… of matter. That matter is never something… jagged is never something insentient, but it is a condensation of consciousness. And this is… I put this verse which is to… *Ājñāna- timirandhasya jñāna añjana śalākayā cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī gurave namaḥ*. And if you want to visit us to recite this verse… very good. *Ājñāna- timirandhasya jñāna añjana śalākayā cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī gurave namaḥ*… He teaches it… it's in my book… *Ājñāna- timirandhasya jñāna añjana śalākayā cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī gurave namaḥ* pratyakṣa dayā. And so all this embodied life, or… in the form of the world… who has assumed concrete form as a coagulation of the liquid mass of consciousness… This *Ājñāna- timirandhasya* is a very powerful statement. What is matter? Matter is nothing but the condensation of consciousness… Rasa… So, this whole liquidity, this whole dynamism… matter is… hardness is all condensation of the Chit Shakti… the essence of consciousness. And this is here the… what *Kula* is in comparison… but that is implied. It is… implies coagulation. And this is where, in a different model, quantum physicists, they can perceive matter in a completely different way than the ordinary. So also a Shiva yogi… he perceives matter in a very different way. Not as something uh… jagged… insentient. But pulsating with that power… pulsating with that dynamism of consciousness. So, these are not just theoretical statements. They have to be brought into experience. So, how they deal with matter… how they understand matter… how… So, as I said about this about Abhinavagupta… that he was so subtle and so sensitive that he did not even want to disturb anything. Because he perceived that this is all consciousness… this is all divine. So, it is all a matter of becoming more and more sensitive. All our practice of meditation, whatever we do… to become more sensitive to that pervasiveness of consciousness in all things, whether it's solid matter or human beings or animals, or even energy. This is the God consciousness which rules all this. But I think that's enough… But anyway, we can leave that just discussion since…
