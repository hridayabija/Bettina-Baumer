Now, in these in the translation... First, a few words uh concerning what we are doing now. 

The tantras have been, not only today, always very sensitive scriptures, prone to misinterpretation, not only today. And Abhinavagupta shows it in one verse, very often speaks about also uh uh vivarana, because he criticizes some commentators before him who have given a wrong interpretation. On page 83 in the translation and page 33 in the Sanskrit in this in the translation... 

First a few words... Somananda... I have not really spoken about Somananda, because um I mean I put the realize very much on Somananda's commentary, which unfortunately is lost in its entirety, and we have only very many quotes in the other very few editions, but from which one can catch his... Somananda's style is very uh succinct and very sharp uh and very clear, and he pays great respect to Somananda, who is, according to him, Paramēśthiguru, the guru of the Paramēśvara himself, says Paramēśvara. 

But, he criticizes other commentators after him who feels his duty, and that is where the continuation of the tradition... Continuity is always the duty to to give an interpretation which is based on the tradition and on experience, because you are just people who have no experience; they just have some fancy thought and interpretation. 

So, firstly we quote some unknown source in some old books... another such verse is also quoted. Unfortunately, we don't know yet where it comes. *“O Lord, I have heard the description of the spiritual knowledge pertaining to *trika*, and so through your favor I have also acquired knowledge pertaining to *trika*.”* 

Ok, it is... Therefore, that which the teachers have taught in accordance with the commentary of venerable Somananda will also do good to all good to all his children. 

*tateva sarvasya pramuktiśunāṃ*

So, the correct commentaries, they will be beneficial, auspicious to all. And then, in the verse... Abhinavagupta has made a blessing. *“Somananda commentary manifest that is bent on extirpating the darkness due to misleading wretched commentaries lacking the refinement of good teaching and tradition that makes the heart lotus his own commentary that makes the heart lotus purified by the discipline of *trika* bloom. That by its flashing luster melts the accumulated spleen of the fools.”* 

So here, on this one side, we have criticism of the bad commentaries, but on the other he states what his commentary is doing. It is uh... it makes the heart lotus, here we have this beautiful lotus uh bloom in the heart hearts which are purified by *śāstra* *śāstra*, by the *vidyā*, by the tradition of *trika*. So, what the tradition, what the tantric scripture should do, purify the hearts, purify the hearts from uh bondage from *mala*, and only in that purified heart which then blooms like the lotus can this uh liberation take, this deep coming with the the the *jñāna parokṣa* with the light of his commentary the heart lotus will bloom. 

*tateva sarvasya pramuktiśunāṃ*

And then, that authentic tradition, authentic interpretation, it gives blessing, gives auspiciousness and uh liberation to all. So I... this came to my mind, because we had one verse where he states the purpose of this uh commentary. And this is another one where he uh utters his criticism of of other commentators, that they have not survived, these other commentaries. But, it is also the tradition of this kind of filter, you know, if you think you are very much working in this field, which manuscripts have survived. So, manuscripts of those commentaries have not survived, because they didn't have any success. They they were not accepted. And but, of course, others have also been lost, and Somananda's uh really has been lost; it's only about the quotes here and there. So many things have been lost. But also, uh texts which are not worth preserving have not been recopied. That's the work: manuscript means copying, recopying of that which is really worth preserving. 

Now we come back to our  *kārikā*... city then... you remember the first first question of the daily *alotaṃ kal ēva satya kālikā city*. That, I mean, the sentence can be analyzed in this or that way, but Goddess, the important, in three very powerful words, like actually I don't call it concepts because concept is something which you define very clear cut, but you see 60 meanings of *alota*, and still it is not exhausted uh in three very powerful words, which powerful in the sense they became they lead to an experience, the very word, and the... happens sometimes. 

Now, *alotaṃ*... we have seen, it is of course there at the beginning and end everywhere. Now, this... how is this *kālikā city* now related to *alota*? It is of course *alotaṃ kālikā city*. That *alota*, which by itself is, denotes the perfection, *anuttara*. Then, it is not the aim of the prayer, the daily praise for the teacher is *anuttara*, but not for the *kālikā city*, because the moment you have *anuttara*, you also have *kālikā city*. And this is the very specific uh tantric understanding. You don't have an absolute *Brahman* somewhere and the floating uh totally disconnected from the world, but that very absolute is at the same time destroying that fullness of perfection which connects you with the body, with the cosmos, with everything, as we have seen in the beginning of the work... 

*kula* and *kaulika*. So, that *anuttara*... it does, if, even without your aim, should be *anuttara*. That's why a quest for the absolute. And the moment you you have the question, you have some glimpse of it. Then, *kaulikasiddhi* will be given. It is not separate from the world, not separate from the body, not separate from the Shiva is not separate from Shakti uh and so it is that integration and that uh perfection including the world of the body in the cosmos and everything. It is inclusive, and that, in that sense, the relationship between *anuttara* and *kaulikasiddhi* is is very clear. And what is the real aim of the question, the prayer, or quest that we is *chit-chaitanya-samatā. Yenābhivyaktāmatreṇa kechit chaitanyasamātāṃ vrajanti*. That, just we have to see still the four meanings of uh *kaulikasiddhi* which he gives, same for not sixty minutes, but uh but that is of course a privilege of *anuttara*, which is life itself. No entity which is devoid of the light of manifestation can come into existence. That is their entire philosophy. It is the labor of consciousness: is without the light of consciousness, nothing ever can manifest by very definition. Now, *kauliki* gives that which is related to the whole universe, including the body... *Siddhi*, or achievement of the acquisition of bliss by turning around to have a firm hold on that very principle. That is the light of the universal consciousness. In other words, identity with the perfect I-feeling of Shiva, who is the highest consciousness and whose name service stands for, or the eternal God, the light of consciousness. So...

On 13th, at the top, after the quotation from Shiva Drishti... *kule jatasiddhi kule jatasiddhi* Just just after the quotation. If you have found that this being... *kule jatasiddhi śaktyādi rūpa prasara ārambha ārabhhya bahir bhāva paṭalaṁ vichhāsa paryantan bheda-abhāsa-samānataḥ tāntrikaḥ tad evānugraham mahāprakāśātman antaḥ kṛta bodhaṁ mayā viśva-bhāva-prasāraḥ anumatarā eva nirapekṣa- svataḥ svātantryāt svātantryeśvarya- camatkāra-bhārā-bharaṁ vichhāya*. 

So, uh *kaulika siddhanta* in the three directions, from the yogi who visualizes *anuttara* to the divine body of *anuttara* itself, which manifests in multiciplicity, the body and the of cosmos. And uh, as I say, uh the two entities come together, the first and the last, that the matter or physical reality is nothing but the condensation of consciousness. And this is again fundamental for the entire philosophy, the motive for this coming together... there is no necessity, there is no obligation, there is no bondage, that the motive is nothing but the divine freedom. And that is why when we look at the multiplicity and as an unfoldment of this freedom, and that is why perhaps uh all all possibilities are there... Infinite possibilities out of that divine consciousness flowing out, and which are not to be considered *a priori* as something limiting, something uh uh binding us, but as an expression of this freedom. So, to to understand this, if if it is derived from uh the ideas today, then it comes to the the relativity of time. Because, the day, as he had said before also, what is this day? The human day? There's a day of *Brahma*, there is the day of the *yogi*, there is the day of *Vishnu*, and they are different durations and different units. There is no such objective thing as day. So, if the consciousness present, the present present presently, that what is this day? So, the question in the concept of time itself... 

***satya*** in this context, if from this perspective, in this context means of at the same instant... simultaneity here does not connote simultaneity of the moment but rather terminating in reality that the *paryavasāyi tad-tad-paryavasāyi* is not in a temporal sense. But, it is in this way that the word ***satya*** has to be understood. And if you realize ***satya*** from *sat* being... therefore, if ***satya*** is to be taken in the sense of at that very moment, then only the count of the limitation of the present moment, the past and future moments will be rejected. It is always relative. If you say “moment”, or if you say “day”, “today”, or “at this moment”, or “every moment”, it is always related to what is before, what is after. So, you cannot avoid the temporal relationships. And that is why he connects ***satya*** with *sat* being. It is the totality implied in *kula kaulika*, which is necessarily beyond time. 

Then uh it takes again for the *kula*... total objectivity that has been destroyed so far is the collective form chapter of the rays of the divine sun that is vital and is of the essence of light. When, however, that *kula* acquires the *roopa* and stoppage by identification with the inner supramental consciousness, then it is full of the value of the ambrosia of supreme bliss. It is *anuttara*, transcendent beyond space and time after *ananda* of the form of the *satchidananda* ever-existing. So, that is why this ***satya*** to the to the that ever-existing. Not just in this moment or this today, but ever present. 

Now, uh we go step by step, and uh this very first *mantra* of verse deserves to be taken very um limited... afterwards, we can leave on because of lack of time, but this... our... every word... the first portion of the Vedic has to be taken into account... *yena vijñātaṁ mataṁ jñātaṁ*. So, this is uh... We have already said that *vijñāna* is not definitely not in the sense of modern in the sense of science uh modern sense, but *viśeṣajña* *viśeṣajña*. And the *viśeṣa* is mystical knowledge, as we have in the case of *vijñāna bhairava*, which that is said and the uh *tantraśāstra*. *yena* means *anuttareṇa*, by which *anuttara*... *jñātaṁ* means *viśeṣeṇa ajñātaṁ*. This thing, if we know uh that it will not... So, by knowing which, by knowing this *anuttara*... *mataṁ*... the analysis within uh *yogajana* uh we we interpret more and more; we don't need to go into this. But, *vijñātamataṁ* means that *anuttara* by which that part *mataṁ* is said to be not known. *mataṁ*, as he analyzes into *mataṁ* is *mataṁ*... *mataṁ* is that *vijña*... this, if we interpret as *mataṁ* and *mataṁ mataṁ*. But, the second interpretation is very important. That which is very well known, that is known from conviction, is already known, and there we come to the problem of relativity. It's recognition; it is not a knowledge of something else, something totally... something unknown. But be in the sense of that which is already known. Being once already fully known, *satkṛt mataṁ*, after that it is not to be known again. *jñātamataṁ* means already known as an object, but in essence of *jñāna*, never as subject. So, *jñātamataṁ* means that which is already known as an object. Similarly, it also means *māyā*, which is known as an object being an objectivity. But, now the *jñātamataṁ* is that in which both the known objects and *māyā* are ceased. Not be in the sense of negation in a sense of negation to unknowing... There there are other other... this is something comes only, it is only by unknowing of external externality. Therefore, *vijñātamattareṇa* is that... that in which objects that are all known objects, but, being identified with the subject, that being is what is unknown light. And therefore, *māyā* also will not be, because it is not something else, not something dualistic. But, that that objectivity of knowledge reflects back to the subject today. To the subject who throws light, by whose light of consciousness the object is known. So, it is a reversal of the knowledge of something object to the unknowing of the objectivity, and then return to the subjectivity. 

Three ideas have been brought about in the above explanation. 

First, this *anuttara* by means of which is maintained itself, for which alone exists the pleasures of *pramāṇa pramāṇa-prameya* and *pramita*, the phases of knowledge. To the Self once recognized, once, requires no further support through *pramāṇa* etc. So, recognition is that Self... Southern enlightenment, where no other methods are required. Tree, तो object cannot replace the subject. That means, the object enquired to not create this *vikalpa* matter. 

So, I think this is uh very clear, and as we have said in the very beginning, the the... already states, the... already states most of the thing that she is asking for. She's already saying only one thing remains, and that is *kevala-samādhi*. She... what she is praying for or what she is asking for is *jñāna-vikālpam-athena*, because that is already supposed to be there once you know that, and nothing else. And then, let me get that which gives me *kevala-samādhi*... *kevala-samādhi* which is, and that is why the whole procedure of that verse which contains such powerful words, but it is leading to *kevala-samādhi*. And this also implies that what we can presume the *yogi* or *sādhaka* of the *Yogakāra* has to do is to aim at *kevala-samādhi*. Because, another is given, and along with another, the qualification is also given. So, what he has to aim at is *kevala-samādhi*. That is why this word is the most uh sought after, most important to understand, and where I mean Up Gupta goes in great detail of of about it implies. Still, of course, it is not complete. We keep hints at many things. And uh that he also explains many aspects of this *kevala-samādhi* which we have to develop and to aim at and to understand etc. 

So, we will start with *kevala-samādhi* this morning and probably continue in the afternoon. And then only we can go to the verses about *yogi*. The Sanskrit... this speech that, in the second feeling and against, they wanted give you was different meanings of *kevala*. *kevala* obviously is feminine, and that is why it is a *shakti*. But, there is a masculine *kevala* which not only means both... it also... But, it means that *yogi* who has attained the state of *kevala*, or who has been uh the *yogi* who has become a *kevala*, who has attained the power of moving freely in the space of consciousness... Consciousness is always put in brackets because it's not uh not just space, but *kha* and *ākāśa* and *vyoman* and all the synonyms of *kha*. They are in space. And, from the *Upanishads* onwards, they always have the implication of *Brahman* or the Absolute. So, and of consciousness. So, *kha*... and *kha* uh means also... And that is where this very high level meaning comes now, because to the body *kha* is also the openings in the body. So, the senses. So, depending on the... Even from the *Atharva Veda* onwards, there are nine openings. And then, this body is described as a *pura*, as a castle, or as a city, or as a uh temple which has these doors or windows, and the... our senses are these windows by which we communicate outside, and at the same time the outside comes inside. So, *kha*... And you remember that *Katha Upanishad*, the... says that *svayaṃ-bhū* covered the holes in the body outside so that it could see outside. And *Kaśyapa*, a certain sage desiring immortality... after the chuckled, he turned his eyes within instead of without. Not just “eyes within”, and to perceive the Atman directly. And, desire immortality, this one verse of the *Katha Upanishad*, which is the classical uh text for the whole movement from the external to the internal, and which is quoted again and again. But after he covered the *khani-s* with *nachikanda-s*, *Kaśyapa*. And with that knowledge, then, desiring immortality, after the chuckled, he turned his eyes within. This is the last any... Turned his eyes within. He found the Self directly. So, this is the *kha*, the the holes, the openings. And so, the synonyms of *kha*, which are also very much used by the Tantrics or the uh... *ākāśa* is of course very common, especially in the *Upanishads*... *vyoman*... *kha*, *vyoman*, *ākāśa*, but it's beyond... beyond all the uh terms denoting the sky and the space, and which the implication is also the ether, but the ether is not the important... important aspect is the free space, open space. Now, with this affixed *chari*, from *char*, to move... moving in that space. She, *kecharī*, she who moves in that space of consciousness... I... And of course it's also translated as “the void”, and *Shunyata* is one of the... So, moving in the void. And as we said, the *kha* is very frequently used in the feminine because it is the *shakti*. And as in the early Tantras, and maybe from this Tantric *Upanishad*, *kecharī* is always a class of *yoginīs* moving in the air who can bestow supernatural powers. And it is well known in all the Tantric systems that it is the *yoginīs* who uh who bestow powers. And, but it can also be negative. If that *yoginī* is not qualified, their influence can also be negative. That's why we have this ambiguity of the *kevala-s* and of the *yoginīs*. But then, uh *kecharī* is a name of the *shakti* as such. And then, also one of the five uh *pañca-prāṇa*, the uh common system, where the different levels uh of the uh *shaktis* uh which manifest... it will come... one of the meanings uh it will come, this... one of the meanings, but not the uh... *kecharī* goes already beyond the *kecharī*. And which is connected with the *shakti chakra*, the wheel of energies mainly in the common system. So, this... it will come in the interpretation here of *kevala-samādhi*. And yes... Somehow going with this now. But then, unfortunately, we don't have all the texts here, and the *pratibhijñā-hṛdaya chimarāja* uh gives uh beautiful interpretation of *kecharī*, but I don't have the text here. Maybe uh maybe not too useful. But they be not there. And also in the uh *Śivasūtra-s*. The *Śivasūtra-s*, they find *kecharī* as Shiva's own state, his state of consciousness. This is very important because, if you remember the beginning of that verse where it says that uh it is not... it's only through *shakti* that you can attain Shiva, and that any *avarasthā*... *avarasthā* is also feminine... any state is a state of *shakti*. The state of Shiva is *shakti*. And it's *kecharī*. So, all these things... They are different uh dimensions of the same uh term which, since it pervades from the highest uh level of the *shakti* to the *yoginīs* to the to the... the different aspects of the *pañca-prāṇa* and and the *yoginīs*. So, so many levels are uh implied. And then, that so many things are connected with *kecharī*, but uh which are not exactly connected with our *kevala-samādhi*. 

*kecharī-mudrā*... *kecharī-mudrā* is uh again at different levels, *hatha yoga* etc., particular *mudrā*, a physical *mudrā*, but situated at the higher levels of the mystical uh attitude. It's the highest mystical attitude. The the... it says in Chapter 22, I think 22, 32 of Abhinavagupta's speaks of the *mudrā-s* that *kecharī mudrā* is the highest. And he uh... so they don't have one text here. But um just to show you that *kecharī* is very pervasive and uh very important to understand these different levels of the *shakti*, from the highest to the *yoginīs* and to the the practical aspect of *mudrā* etc.... 

harmony because equality has the mention of the... the quantity gives equality. But, it's not equality in the sense of the French Revolution, the French Revolution uh of democracy, but equality in the sense of the balance, balance of the of the different elements in the harmony... in harmony itself. *saṃghaṭa*... such a true *saṃghaṭa* is that unity of harmony with that divine power who is moving in the space of consciousness. So, it is a very, very uh high concept, and I think as far as possible, maybe one should avoid the Buddhist tantras. Whether these tantras... because if you have in your mind, it is there talking in terms of the the *ḍākinī*. *Ḍākinī* and *kevalī* is there. So, for them, the *ḍākinī*... *kevalī*, they are synonymous, and *ḍākinī*, in the context of Buddhist tantra... they generally avoid then then this tantra as such. I don't know the tantra, but generally, the tantras in Shaiva Agamas are in the Śākta Śākta ideology... Goddess is the worshiper, she... *Śrīvidyā*. 

But, it is *mudrā* by nature? 

Yeah, *kevalī mudrā* is *kevalī mudrā*, of course. But, *kevalī saṃghaṭa*... this is so... So, this... that's why this uh uh Trika tantras have very unique features which uh otherwise, in many tantras, you find parallel passages, parallel expressions, and so on. But, as far as my limited knowledge goes, there are certain unique features, and *kevalī saṃghaṭa* is a unique one, important. It implies... doesn't mean *kevalī* itself implies a dynamism. Śakti because of her very existence, it is dynamism of the of the energy, of the supreme energy, and to be in harmony with that dynamic energy... that is *kevalī*. That is *kevalī*, to be one with that dynamic energy, then *kevalī* is Śakti related highest energy. Not from here. But, in his interpretation, he actually starts from the *pañcama*, the levels of the *kevalī*... *kevalī*, *kevalī*, *kevalī*, *kevalī samvit*. Now, these uh aspects of the power which move in different realms, different uh aspects. One is uh in the sense organs and the one is *kevalī Vīryā* is uh external and external uh objects or external space. And uh uh *kevalī* is the highest... yeah. The consciousness and *kevalī* in the senses, *kevalī* in the objects, and *kevalī*... *kevalī*, *kevalī* is external and *kevalī* in the physical uh reality... 

Let us read the beginning of the commentary, which is on page 38. 

*“The meaning of kevalī is as follows. That Śakti is kevalī who, abiding in the heart, that is *samvit*, which is identical with herself, roams about the distinctions in various ways. Generally, this kevalī, having universal aspect, functions in three ways. She, as kevalī, brings about the knowledge of objects. This kevalī effects movements, such as grasping, relinquishing, et cetera. As kevalī exists in the form of objective existences. That is, kevalī exists as kevalī in the form of *antaḥkaraṇa*. As kevalī in the form of *bahiṣkaraṇa*, that is outer senses. As kevalī in the form of objective existences, as the power of blue, et cetera, or subjective existences, pleasure, etc. Similarly, in the individual aspects, the Śaktis that are known successively as *vyūmacaryā*, *vyūma* and the void of consciousness in which the distinction between subject and object has not yet appeared. As kevalī in the form of *antaḥkaraṇa*, in which there is just appearance of knowledge. As kevalī in the form of the outer senses, suggesting the appearance of diversity, in which state there is diversity of the knower from the knowable object. As kevalī in the form of powers or existence in which there is the preponderance of clear diversity in the objects. These are in reality, according to the principle of non-duality, non-distinct from kevalī which abides in the essential nature as *samvit*. So, all these manifestations of the power in different levels, they are actually one with kevalī.”* 

Thus, that Śakti of the supreme Lord is *samvit* alone... they are not different from *kevalī*, which is the power of... which is the power of consciousness. It is *eka*. *eka eva sa parameśvarī śakti*... this is important. This he gives stress to the unity of the supreme divine energy, not the multiplicity of the three. *eka eva sa parameśvarī śakti*. 

Then he quotes... *Śaktyā yuktasya jagat kṛtsnam śaktimān svā maheśvaraḥ*. The whole world is uh his energies. But the the the Lord of the energy is *Maheśvara*. This Śakti constitute the five levels, and the Great Lord is the possessor of all these Śaktis. Or, to put it in to another interpretation, these things which are not *antaḥkaraṇa*... also the multiplicity of the uh goddesses and so on. They are merely... they are the manifestations of Śakti *Maheśvara*, and therefore, the another manifestation is the Vedic form of *svātantrya śakti*. *svātantrya antaḥkaraṇa*... It would not be proper to have a fixed, rigid order or separate entities between *kevalī* *śakti*, whose sphere is the Self, *kevalī*, whose sphere is the *antaḥkaraṇa*, mind... *vikcaryā*, whose sphere is the senses, and *kevalī*, whose sphere is external objects, because in that case an intimate connection between them would not be possible. And also because, as completely separate from *kevalī*, they would not appear at all. It is against the making a strict division between these different functions uh. But, they are all derived or all connected with each other. All aspects of the power of consciousness. 

And then comes a very important connection, and I think I'll leave this for the afternoon. Uh I think first we digest what we have uh heard so far. And because this is so important, that afternoon again we'll go more into the interpretation... *kevalī saṃghaṭa*. 

Yes sir, this is very parallel to the *parā paśyantī madhyamā* and *vaikhari*; that breakup is also very similar.

Yes, some entities are same. But, they have different fields of operation. They operate through the senses, then to the inner senses or whatever uh. So, it is different, different. But, the the stages of consciousness is...
