## Request for Dalai Lama's Mantra and Swamiji's Teachings

The session began by addressing two audience requests, demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity and responsiveness.

* **The Dalai Lama's Mahāmṛtyuñjaya Mantra:** This request came from attendees who missed the previous day's session where the mantra was played. The Mahāmṛtyuñjaya Mantra, a powerful Vedic hymn addressed to Lord Shiva, is believed to bestow longevity, healing, and liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. By honoring this request, the speaker acknowledges the significance of this mantra within the broader spiritual context and provides a second opportunity for attendees to engage with its potent vibrations.

* **Swamiji's Teachings:** The inquiry about Swamiji's video teachings pointed towards a desire for further guidance and wisdom.  While the speaker lacked the requested video, the suggestion to compile YouTube clips reflected resourcefulness and a willingness to utilize technology for disseminating spiritual knowledge.  This highlights the evolving landscape of spiritual learning, where traditional methods intersect with modern platforms, making teachings more accessible.

## Vibhūtis: Signposts and Obstacles on the Path of Enlightenment

The conversation then transitioned to a complex yet crucial aspect of spiritual unfoldment: the role of *vibhūtis*. These extraordinary powers, often considered supernatural, are frequently misunderstood and can become points of confusion for practitioners.

* **Vibhūtis as Milestones and Signposts:** Just as a traveler relies on milestones to gauge their progress, a spiritual aspirant can view *vibhūtis* as markers on the path of awakening. These experiences, such as altered dream states or heightened intuition, can signify a deepening connection with one's true nature. They offer encouragement, affirming that the practices are bearing fruit and that the journey is progressing. 

* **The Allure and Pitfalls of Siddhis:** It's crucial to differentiate between *vibhūtis* as signposts and *siddhis*, often associated with the pursuit of power.  While *vibhūtis* arise spontaneously as by-products of spiritual growth, *siddhis* can become objects of desire, leading to ego inflation and attachment. The speaker cautioned against seeking these powers for personal gain or using them to manipulate the material world. Such pursuits, rather than leading towards liberation, ultimately bind the individual to the illusion of separateness.

* **Maintaining Equanimity: Neither Negating Nor Overestimating:** Navigating the emergence of *vibhūtis* requires a delicate balance: recognizing their significance without becoming fixated on them.  The speaker emphasized that these experiences, while validating, should not be misconstrued as the ultimate goal. Attributing them to the ego ("I have achieved this power") can create a dangerous pitfall, reinforcing the sense of individuality that spiritual practice seeks to transcend. True progress lies in witnessing these experiences with detachment, integrating the insights gained while remaining anchored in the understanding that they are transitory phenomena on a much grander journey.

## Unmeṣa: The Awakening of Transcendental Awareness

The discourse then delved into the profound concept of *unmeṣa*, a term laden with multifaceted meanings.  

* **Unveiling the Inner Light:** The term *unmeṣa* is often translated as "opening of the eyes," symbolizing a shift from a limited, ego-centric perspective to a state of expanded awareness.  This awakening, however, transcends the physical act of opening one's eyes. It signifies a blossoming of consciousness, a movement from darkness to light, from contraction to expansion.

* **From Introversion to Universal Consciousness:**  The text draws a parallel between *unmeṣa* and the transition from *nimilana samādhi* to *unmilana samādhi*. *Nimilana samādhi*, often associated with deep states of meditative absorption, involves a withdrawal of the senses and a turning inward of awareness. *Unmilana samādhi*, on the other hand, represents an expansive state where consciousness, while remaining deeply rooted in its source, radiates outwards, embracing the entirety of manifestation.

* **Awakening of the Prabuddha:** It is crucial to note that the text specifically addresses this concept of *unmeṣa* in relation to the *Prabuddha* - the partially enlightened being. This implies that the full awakening of the *Suprabuddha* transcends even this expansive state of consciousness. The *Suprabuddha*, having dissolved all illusory boundaries, rests in a state of absolute unity, where even the distinction between subject and object ceases to exist.

* **Utpaladeva's Verse on True Awakening:** To elucidate the essence of *unmeṣa*, the speaker introduced a verse by Utpaladeva, a revered master of Kashmir Shaivism:

   > **ekacintāprasaktasya yataḥ syāt aparodhayā
   unmeṣas tad vijñeyaḥ svayam tam upalakṣayet
   tad śobhā-bralīyatā tadāsyāḥ paramaṃ padam**

   This verse emphasizes several key aspects of attaining true awakening:

   * **One-Pointedness as the Gateway:** The phrase *ekacintāprasaktasya*, "deeply engrossed in one thought," highlights the importance of *ekāgratā*, or one-pointed focus. This doesn't imply forceful concentration but rather a state of effortless absorption, where the mind, freed from distractions and mental chatter, rests its attention on a single point, often an object of meditation or a sacred sound. This one-pointedness becomes the gateway to transcending the limitations of the thinking mind.

   * **Cessation of Obstacles:** The words *yataḥ syāt aparodhayā*, "by what means is it available," point towards the significance of removing internal obstacles that hinder the blossoming of *unmeṣa*. These obstacles, deeply rooted in our conditioning, manifest as limiting beliefs, negative emotions, and habitual patterns that cloud our perception and prevent us from experiencing the fullness of our true nature.

   * **Direct Experience as the Ultimate Validation:** The phrase *svayam tam upalakṣayet*, "he will experience it for himself," emphasizes the inherently personal nature of awakening.  No amount of intellectual understanding or secondhand knowledge can substitute for the direct experience of *unmeṣa*. This realization dawns through dedicated practice, inner purification, and the grace of the Divine.

* **Stillness in Motion, Motion in Stillness:** Utpaladeva's verse further describes this state as *śobhā-bralīyatā*, often translated as "stillness in movement and movement in stillness."  This seemingly paradoxical phrase encapsulates the dynamic equilibrium that characterizes true awakening.  The mind, though still and silent, pulsates with an underlying vibrancy, a subtle dance of awareness that permeates all experience. This concept finds its visual expression in the image of Nataraja.

## The Significance of Nataraja: Stillness in Movement, Movement in Stillness

The image of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer, serves as a profound visual metaphor for the state of *unmeṣa*. 

* **The Cosmic Dance:**  Nataraja, a manifestation of Lord Shiva, is often depicted dancing within a circle of fire. This dance represents the rhythmic play of creation and destruction, the ebb and flow of energy that sustains the universe. 

* **Stillness Amidst Dynamism:**  While Nataraja's dance embodies dynamism and vibrancy, his face remains serene, untouched by the surrounding chaos.  This stillness within movement symbolizes the state of a realized being - deeply engaged in the world yet rooted in a profound inner peace, unperturbed by the fluctuations of the mind and senses. 

* **A Visual Representation of Unmeṣa:** Visualizing Nataraja can serve as a powerful practice for embodying the essence of *unmeṣa*. By contemplating this image, we begin to internalize the qualities it represents - the stillness within activity, the tranquility amidst chaos, the dynamic equilibrium that characterizes true awakening.

## Commentary on Unmeṣa: The Role of One-Pointedness and Letting Go

Śemarāja, a renowned commentator on Kashmir Shaivism, further elucidates the concept of *unmeṣa* in his writings. 

* **Two Interpretations of Aparā Eva Udaya:**  Śemarāja deconstructs the phrase *aparā eva udaya*, which can be interpreted as "the rising of another."  The more superficial reading refers to the emergence of a new thought, a common occurrence within the fluctuating mind. However, the deeper, more relevant interpretation points towards the manifestation of a transcendental awareness, a state of consciousness that transcends the limitations of ordinary perception.

* **Effortless Absorption, Not Forceful Control:**  Śemarāja emphasizes that this state arises not through forceful concentration but through an effortless absorption in a single thought. This highlights the importance of surrendering to a higher power, allowing the mind to settle naturally into a state of stillness. It is from this place of surrender that *unmeṣa* can spontaneously arise.

* **Letting Go to Allow Unfolding:** The concept of "letting go" plays a crucial role in Śemarāja's commentary. This surrender isn't about becoming passive but rather about releasing our grip on control, allowing ourselves to be guided by a force greater than our limited ego.  By relinquishing our attachment to outcomes, we create the space for *unmeṣa* to blossom organically.

## Supernormal Experiences: The Allure and the Distraction

As one progresses on the spiritual path, various experiences may arise, often defying ordinary logic and challenging our understanding of reality.  These experiences, while intriguing, require careful navigation.

* **The Double-Edged Sword of Siddhis:** *Siddhis*, often considered superpowers, hold a peculiar allure for spiritual seekers. While they can signify a deepening connection with subtler realms, they can also become traps for the ego. The speaker cautioned against seeking these powers for personal gain, emphasizing that true spiritual progress lies in transcending the allure of the phenomenal world, not becoming further entangled in it.

* **Vibhūtis as Guideposts, Not Destinations:** It's crucial to remember that extraordinary experiences, while validating, are not the ultimate goal. They are like beautiful vistas encountered on a long journey.  We can appreciate their beauty, integrate the insights they offer, but we must ultimately continue moving towards our destination.

* **The Importance of Discernment:** Navigating these experiences requires a high degree of *viveka*, or discernment. We must learn to differentiate between experiences arising from the ego's desire for power and those stemming from genuine spiritual unfoldment. This discernment requires introspection, self-honesty, and guidance from wise teachers who have traversed this path before us.

## Experiences of the Yogī: Bindu, Nāda, Rūpa, and Rasaḥ

The text then described four specific experiences that often arise for practitioners:

* **Bindu: The Experience of Inner Light:** *Bindu*, often translated as "point" or "drop," refers to the experience of an inner light, frequently visualized in the *bhūmadya* (space between the eyebrows), also known as the Ajna Chakra. This light, radiant and pulsating, symbolizes the awakening of spiritual awareness, a glimpse into the luminous nature of reality.

* **Nāda: The Inner Sound Current:** *Nāda*, meaning "sound" or "tone," signifies the perception of an inner sound current, often described as a high-pitched humming, ringing, or roaring. This *anahata-nāda*, or "unstruck sound," arises not from external sources but from the depths of consciousness itself. It represents the primordial vibration from which all creation manifests, the cosmic hum that underlies all existence.

* **Rūpa: Visions of the Subtle Realm:** *Rūpa*, meaning "form" or "vision," encompasses the experience of seeing subtle forms, colors, and images. These visions can range from geometric patterns to deities to landscapes of ethereal beauty. It's crucial to note that these visions are not hallucinations but rather glimpses into subtler realms of reality, accessed through the purification of perception. 

* **Rasaḥ: The Divine Taste of Nectar:** *Rasaḥ*, often translated as "taste" or "essence," refers to the experience of a sublime taste, often described as sweet, nectar-like, or ambrosial. This *rasaḥ* is not experienced through the physical tongue but through a heightened spiritual palate. It signifies the blissful taste of divine consciousness, a taste that nourishes the soul and awakens it to its inherent bliss nature.

* **Verse 10:  A Description of the Experiences:** These experiences, while unique, are often intertwined and can manifest in various combinations.  Verse 10 describes their emergence:

   > **ato bindur bindur ato nādaḥ rūpaṃ asmāt ato rasaḥ
   pravartante acireṇaiva kṣobhakatvenā dehinaḥ**

   This verse highlights the following:

   * **Natural Arising:** These experiences are not forcefully conjured but arise naturally as a result of dedicated practice and the purification of the mind and senses. 
   * **Transitory Nature:** The phrase *acireṇaiva*, meaning "in a short time," underscores the fleeting nature of these experiences.  They are but glimpses into the subtler dimensions of reality, not permanent states to be grasped or clung to.
   * **Potential for Disturbance:** The word *kṣobhakatvenā*, meaning "disturbing factor," serves as a reminder that even these seemingly blissful experiences can become obstacles if we become attached to them.

## Spiritual Senses and Synesthesia: Beyond Ordinary Perception

The discourse then explored the nature of these experiences, differentiating them from hallucinations and emphasizing their connection to spiritual senses.

* **Spiritual Senses:  Gateways to Subtler Realms:** The experiences of *bindu*, *nāda*, *rūpa*, and *rasaḥ* are not perceived through our ordinary five senses but rather through refined, spiritual senses. These subtle senses, dormant in most individuals, become activated through spiritual practices, allowing us to perceive dimensions of reality that are ordinarily hidden from view.

* **Synesthesia: A Blending of Perceptions:** As these spiritual senses awaken, a phenomenon known as synesthesia can occur.  Synesthesia involves a blending of sensory perceptions, such as "hearing" colors or "seeing" sounds. While synesthesia can occur in individuals with specific neurological conditions, it can also arise in spiritual practitioners as a result of heightened sensitivity and the merging of sensory boundaries.

* **Saint Benedict's Vision: A Universal Experience:** The speaker shared the story of Saint Benedict, a Christian mystic who experienced a vision of the entire universe bathed in divine light. This example highlights that such experiences are not limited to any specific religion or tradition. They point towards a universal phenomenon, accessible to all who embark on the inner journey.

* **Distinguishing Between Levels of Reality:**  The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing the qualitative difference between ordinary sensory perception and experiences accessed through spiritual senses. This discernment is crucial to avoid misinterpreting these experiences or attributing them to mental instability.

## The Transient Nature of Experiences and the Importance of Viveka

The speaker reiterated that these extraordinary experiences, while profound, are ultimately transitory.

* **Fleeting Glimpses, Not Permanent States:** It's crucial to remember that *bindu*, *nāda*, *rūpa*, and *rasaḥ*, are not permanent states of being. They are fleeting glimpses into the subtler dimensions of reality, gifts that grace our journey but are not the destination itself.

* **Attachment as an Obstacle to Progress:**  The allure of these experiences can lead to attachment, which becomes a significant obstacle to further progress. Clinging to these transient states prevents us from moving deeper into the heart of our true nature, the vast expanse of pure awareness.

* **Cultivating Viveka:  The Key to Discernment:** Navigating these experiences requires cultivating *viveka*, the faculty of discernment. *Viveka* allows us to distinguish between experiences that bind us to the illusion of separateness and those that liberate us into greater freedom.  It helps us recognize the difference between spiritual inflation (identifying with extraordinary experiences) and genuine spiritual growth (transcending identification with all phenomena).

## Obstacles in Meditation and the Illusion of Siddhis

The text then referenced Patanjali's *Yogasūtra*, a seminal text on Yoga, to further explore the paradoxical nature of extraordinary experiences.

* **Distractions in Meditation:** While experiences like *bindu*, *nāda*, *rūpa*, and *rasaḥ* may seem extraordinary in our ordinary state of awareness (*vyutthāna*), they become distractions in meditation. In deep states of meditative absorption (*samādhi*), the mind seeks to move beyond all sensory phenomena, including those perceived through spiritual senses.

* **Siddhis as Obstacles to Samādhi:** Even *siddhis*, often considered the pinnacle of yogic accomplishment, are viewed as obstacles in the context of *samādhi*. They divert our attention from the ultimate goal of Yoga: the realization of our true nature as pure consciousness, free from all limitations.

* **Transcending the Allure of the Phenomenal:** This teaching highlights the importance of aligning our aspirations with the ultimate goal of liberation. We must learn to recognize that true fulfillment lies not in acquiring powers or experiences, no matter how extraordinary, but in the realization of our inherent freedom from all that is transient and conditioned. 

## Merging with Unmeṣa: Transcending Limitations

The eleventh *kārikā* introduced the concept of merging with *unmeṣa*, a state that transcends all previous experiences:

> **atha unmeṣātmanā svabhāve dehapramatṛtām nimajjati** 
> **tadākāram api parapramatṛtām labhate**. 

* **Dissolving the Body-Bound Identity:** The phrase *dehapramatṛtām nimajjati*, meaning "sinks his psychophysical self," describes the process of dissolving the identification with the limited, body-bound sense of self. This isn't about physically transcending the body but rather about transcending the limiting beliefs and attachments that confine us to a contracted sense of self.

* **Embracing the Supreme Subjectivity:** The words *parapramatṛtām labhate*, meaning "experiences the state of the highest experience," point towards the realization of our true nature as *parapramatṛ*, the supreme subject. This state transcends all limitations, encompassing the entirety of experience without being limited by any particular form or expression. 

* **From Limitation to Limitlessness:** This verse describes a profound shift in identity, a movement from a limited, defined sense of self to a boundless, all-encompassing awareness that recognizes itself as the source and substance of all experience. 

## The Desire to See and the Experience of Pervasive Vision

The *kārikā* continues, elaborating on the nature of this expansive state:

> **tritṛkṣayeva sarvārthān yathā vyāpyā vyāpyā avatiṣṭhate*
> *tathā kiṃ bahunoktenā svayam evāvavabhūchate*

* **Dṛkṣā: The Desire to See:** The verse begins by mentioning *dṛkṣā*, the desire to see. This desire, however, isn't driven by curiosity or the need to acquire knowledge. It stems from a deep longing to know the truth of reality, to experience the universe in its totality.

* **Vyāpyā Avatiṣṭhate: Resting in Pervasive Awareness:**  The phrase *vyāpyā avatiṣṭhate* describes the state of resting in pervasive awareness, a state where consciousness expands to encompass all things. This isn't a conceptual understanding but a lived experience where the subject merges with the object, the knower dissolves into the known.

* **Beyond Description, Realized Through Experience:** The words *tathā kiṃ bahunoktenā svayam evāvavabhūchate*, meaning "then what is the use of saying much? He will experience it for himself," emphasize the limitations of language in describing this state. This realization, beyond the realm of words and concepts, can only be grasped through direct, personal experience.

## Silverman's Interpretation and the Significance of Immobility

The speaker then drew attention to Silverman's insightful translation of the *kārikā*, emphasizing the significance of "remaining immobilized."

* **Avatiṣṭhate as Immobility:** Silverman translates *avatiṣṭhate* as "remains immobilized," highlighting the importance of stillness in attaining this state of pervasive vision. This immobility, however, isn't physical but rather a mental stillness, a cessation of internal movement that allows for the unimpeded flow of consciousness.

* **Stillness as the Foundation for Expansion:** This stillness isn't about suppressing thoughts or emotions but rather about creating a space of inner silence where awareness can expand beyond its conditioned limitations. It is from this place of stillness that we can truly "see" the universe in its totality, unfiltered by our preconceptions and judgments.

##  The Role of Paśyantī and the Universalization of Perception

Silverman further connects this experience to the level of *paśyantī*, a concept deeply rooted in the philosophy of language and consciousness.

* **Paśyantī: The Unmanifest Seed of Language:** In Sanskrit, *paśyantī* refers to the unmanifest level of language, the stage where words exist in their seed form, before they take shape as thoughts and spoken expressions.  It is the realm of pure potentiality, where all possibilities reside in an undifferentiated state.

* **Perception Beyond Vikalpas:** Silverman suggests that at the level of *paśyantī*, perception itself transcends *vikalpas*, the mental constructs that shape our experience of reality.  This means that the "seeing" that occurs isn't bound by the limitations of categories, labels, or interpretations. It is a direct and immediate apprehension of reality, unfiltered by the conceptual mind.

* **Universalized Perception:** This state of *paśyantī* allows for a universalization of perception. The boundaries between subject and object dissolve, and the individual experiences a profound sense of interconnectedness with all things. The "I" expands to encompass the entirety of manifestation, recognizing itself as the very fabric of existence.

##  Śemarāja's Elaboration and the Unification of Objectivity

Śemarāja, in his commentary on the *kārikā*, provides a detailed description of the process that culminates in this state of expansive awareness.

* **Infusing All Objects with Consciousness:** Śemarāja describes the *yogī* as abiding in a state of pervading all objects, infusing them with consciousness. This doesn't imply a forceful projection of awareness but rather a natural overflowing of consciousness that permeates all experience.

* **The Unification of Objectivity:** This process culminates in the "swallowing up" of all phenomena into the fundamental consciousness (*svasaṃvit*). This doesn't mean that objects cease to exist but rather that they are experienced as expressions of the one underlying reality, inseparable from our own being.

* **From Multiplicity to Unity:** This state represents a profound shift from perceiving the world as a collection of separate objects to experiencing it as a unified field of consciousness. The illusory boundaries that separate us from "other" dissolve, revealing the interconnectedness of all things.

##  The Importance of Samāpatti and the Culmination of Practice

The discussion then returned to the concept of *samāpatti*, highlighting its importance in attaining this state of liberation.

* **Samāpatti: Unification with the Object of Meditation:** In Yoga, *samāpatti* refers to a state of profound meditative absorption, characterized by the complete unification of consciousness with the object of meditation. This isn't a state of blankness or emptiness but rather a state of heightened awareness where the distinction between the meditator, the act of meditating, and the object of meditation dissolves. 

* **Samāpatti as a Culmination of Practice:**  This state of *samāpatti* is not a goal to be achieved through effort but rather a natural outcome of dedicated practice, self-purification, and the grace of the Divine.  As we purify our bodies and minds, still our thoughts, and cultivate one-pointed focus, the veils that obscure our true nature gradually dissolve, revealing the radiant light of pure awareness.

## Concluding Thoughts: Transcending the Limitations of Cities

The session concluded by emphasizing that the experience described in the eleventh *kārikā* transcends the limitations of all previously discussed "cities," or stages of spiritual development. 

* **Beyond Stages and Levels:** This state of pervasive awareness, characterized by the unification of objectivity and the realization of our true nature as supreme subjectivity, represents the culmination of the spiritual journey. It is a state beyond stages, levels, and even the concept of attainment itself.

* **The True Meaning of Liberation:**  This concluding reflection served as a reminder that the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is not to acquire powers, experiences, or even knowledge, but to realize our inherent freedom from all limitations.  It is in this realization of our true nature, beyond all concepts and constructs, that we discover true and lasting fulfillment.
