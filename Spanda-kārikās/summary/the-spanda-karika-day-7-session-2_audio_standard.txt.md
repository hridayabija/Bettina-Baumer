##Unveiling the Depths of Spanda Kārikās: A Journey Through Yogic Powers, Awareness, and the Perils of Lassitude

Our exploration ofthe Spanda Kārikās takes us deeper into the third section, a realm where we transition from the rarified heights of *jīvanmukti*to explore the captivating, yet potentially treacherous, domain of yogic powers (*vibhūti*). This exploration is not merely intellectual; it is acall to embody the wisdom of the text, to cultivate the awareness necessary to navigate the spiritual path with clarity and strength.

### The Descent from *Jīvanmukti* and the Allure of Yogic Powers

Imagine, ifyou will, a majestic mountain range. We have spent considerable time exploring the highest peak, *jīvanmukti* - a state of liberation experienced while living, a state where the individual consciousness merges with the cosmic consciousness. Now,we begin our descent, not in a sense of regression, but as a natural progression, mirroring the ebb and flow of spiritual unfolding. This movement echoes the structure of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, where the third chapter, *Vibhūti Pāda*, delves into the realm of extraordinary powers -the *siddhis*. 

This downward movement, from the pinnacle of *jīvanmukti* to the exploration of *vibhūti*, is significant. It reminds us that spiritual awakening is not a linear process, but a dance, a weaving in and out of different states of consciousness. Itunderscores the multifaceted nature of the spiritual journey, where even the attainment of seemingly ultimate states like *jīvanmukti* is but a stepping stone to deeper understanding.

Before we delve further, it's important to recognize that grasping the true essence of *jīvanmukti* is beyond mere intellectual understanding. The Bhagavad Gita, in the second chapter, eloquently captures this point by asking, "Who is the *sthitaprajña*?" - the one who is firmly established in the Self? The answer, the Gita suggests, is not found in scriptures or teachings, but in the direct experience of such abeing. It invites us to shift our focus from conceptual knowledge to embodied wisdom, to observe the *sthitaprajña*'s actions, speech, and way of being.

As we descend from the rarified air of *jīvanmukti* to the realm of *vibhūti*, wetransition our focus from the fully established *suprabuddha*, for whom yogic powers are a natural emanation, to the *prabuddha* - the awakened one who is still progressing on the path. For the *suprabuddha*, yogic powers arise effortlessly, like flowers blooming in their season. They do not cling to these powers, for they are established in a deeper reality. However, for the *prabuddha*, these very same powers, while a testament to their progress, can become a source of attachment and a potential obstacle.

Imagine the *prabuddha*, deeply immersed intheir practice, suddenly experiencing *vibhūtis* - the ability to levitate, to understand the language of animals, or to know the past and future. The initial wonder and awe can easily morph into pride, a sense of being "special" or "chosen." This subtle shift in perception, from seeingthese powers as gifts to claiming them as personal achievements, can be a significant pitfall. It can fuel the desire to display these abilities, to gain fame, to attract followers - all diversions from the true goal of yoga, which is union with the Divine.

The story of the *prabuddha* andtheir relationship with yogic powers is a potent reminder that even the most profound spiritual experiences can become traps if we are not vigilant. It underscores the importance of humility, of recognizing that all spiritual unfoldment is ultimately grace, a gift from the Divine. It is a call to stay grounded in the awareness that the true measureof our progress lies not in the extraordinary powers we may or may not possess, but in the depth of our inner transformation, the steadiness of our awareness, and the compassion that flows from our hearts.

### Dream Mastery and the Importance of *Sāvadhāna*

Moving deeper into the text, weencounter the intriguing concept of dream mastery. Verse 55 (55) of the Spanda Kārikās states:

> "If the energy of breath is meditated upon in its gross and feeble state, at *prāṇaśānta* (and entering the heart), at the time of sleeping, then one will attain mastery over one's dreams." - Spanda Kārikās 55

This mastery, referred to as *suptasvātantriyam* or *muktasvātantriyam*, signifies an unparalleled freedom in the realm of dreams. It suggests that through yogic practice, wecan move beyond being mere puppets of our subconscious, tossed and turned by the whims of our sleeping minds. Instead, we can become conscious navigators of the dream space, aware of its illusions, and capable of influencing its course.

The technique outlined in the verse involves meditating on the *prāṇaśānta* - the point where the breath subsides. This point is often associated with the *Brahmaraṇḍhra*, located in the heart, a subtle energy center considered the gateway to higher consciousness. By focusing on this point, particularly as we drift into sleep, we can potentially access a state of heightened awareness that spillsover into our dreams, granting us greater lucidity and control.

This ability to consciously navigate the dream state offers multiple benefits. Most directly, it provides freedom from nightmares, those unwelcome nocturnal visitors that can leave us feeling drained and anxious. But the implications go far deeper. By mastering our dreams, we beginto unravel the illusory nature of the mind itself. We gain valuable insights into the workings of our subconscious, uncovering hidden patterns and beliefs that may be holding us back. This self-knowledge, gleaned from the depths of our own being, can be a powerful catalyst for transformation.

However, the text classifies thistechnique of dream mastery as *adhama upāya* - an inferior means. This might seem perplexing at first, especially given the profound benefits it offers. The reason for this classification lies in the inherent nature of the practice. It involves effort, a deliberate manipulation of energy, and, most importantly, a desire fora specific outcome - in this case, control over dreams. 

For the truly awakened, such control over the subtle realms, including the dream state, arises spontaneously. It is not something that needs to be sought or attained through effort. It is a natural consequence of their expanded consciousness, their unwavering connection with the Divine. However, for the aspirant still on the path, practices like dream yoga can serve as valuable tools for self-exploration and growth. They can provide glimpses into the boundless potential of the mind and offer a taste of the freedom that awaits those who persevere on the yogic path.

Central to this journey of self-discovery and the eventual mastery of subtle states like dreaming is the quality of *sāvadhāna* - awareness. This term appears repeatedly throughout the Spanda Kārikās, highlighting its paramount importance. Verse three (3) emphasizes this point:

> *yati punaḥ evaṃ sāvadhānauna bhavati tadā na asya yoginaḥ, yogitā iti arthaḥ.*

This translates to, "If a person is not thus attentive (*sāvadhāna*), then he is not fit to be a yogi." The text bluntly states that without this unwavering awareness, onecannot even be considered a yogi, let alone aspire for higher realizations.

This emphasis on *sāvadhāna* resonates strongly with the teachings of the Vijñānabhairava, a text revered for its concise and potent techniques for attaining liberation. The Vijñānabhairavastates, "*yoginaḥ tu viśeṣato’sti sambandhe sāvadhānatāḥ* - The yogi, in particular, is aware of the connection." This connection refers to the interconnectedness of all things, the underlying unity that binds the universe together. It is this awareness, thisconstant remembrance of our connection to the Divine and to all of creation, that distinguishes the yogi from the ordinary person.

The text beautifully illustrates the power of *sāvadhāna* through the example of a *sūtradhāra* - the narrator and director - in the Ramlila of Ramnagar, Varanasi. Imagine a vast open space, filled with thousands of spectators gathered to witness the epic tale of Rama. There are no microphones, no modern amplification systems. The *sūtradhāra*, with a single gesture and a commanding voice that needs no external aid, silences the crowd with a resounding "Chup raho! *Sāvadhān*!" 

This evocative scene encapsulates the essence of *sāvadhāna*. It is not merely about being attentive to external stimuli; it is about cultivating an inner presence, a state of heightened awareness that permeates every aspect of our being.It is about being so attuned to the present moment, so deeply rooted in the Self, that our very presence commands respect and attention.

The significance of *sāvadhāna* extends far beyond commanding silence in a crowd. It forms the bedrock of all spiritual practice. The text further elaborates:> *Anya- anyathā tu svātantrasyāt sṛṣṭiḥ svataḥ tamātmakat- katvatā satataṃ laukika-sevā-jāgat-svapna-vad- vad-tvayi.* Otherwise, the creative power of the divine, Creative power, he translate *svataḥtāḥ*. According to its characteristics, is free in manifesting always all kinds of things to the yogi, both in waking and dream states, as in the case of the common people of the world.

This passage suggests that without the anchoring presence of *sāvadhāna*, the creative power of the Divine (*sṛṣṭiḥ svataḥtāḥ*) can manifest in ways that are confusing and potentially harmful. Like a garden left untended, the mind, without the guiding hand of awareness, becomes a breeding ground for distractions, desires, andattachments. The lines between the real and the unreal blur, much like in the experience of ordinary people caught in the throes of their desires and aversions.

Cultivating *sāvadhāna*, therefore, becomes a spiritual imperative. It is the foundation upon which we can build a stable and fulfilling spiritual life. It is the key to navigating the complexities of the path, discerning truth from falsehood, and ultimately, realizing our true nature as pure, unbounded awareness.

### The Power of *Spanda*, Omniscience, and the Peril of *Jñāni*

Just as a skilled jeweler meticulously cutsand polishes a rough diamond to reveal its inherent brilliance, so too does the practice of yoga, fueled by *sāvadhāna*, unveil our innate capacity for wisdom and power. The Spanda Kārikās highlight this process, drawing a parallel between the focused attention required for clear perception and the unwavering awarenessneeded to tap into the transformative power of *spanda*.

Think back to a time when you encountered something unfamiliar, something that initially appeared vague or indistinct. As you focused your attention, as you brought your full awareness to bear on the object, its details gradually became clearer, its true nature revealed. This same principle, the text suggests, applies to our spiritual journey.

Verse four (4) beautifully articulates this concept:

> *Yathā hi artho asphuṭo dṛṣṭaḥ sāvadhāne picetasi bhūyaḥ sphuṭataḥ bhāti svabaloddyogabhāvītaḥ tathā yatparāmṛto ’nena yathayathāsthitam tattathā balam ākramya na cirāt saṁpravṛttate.* Just as a thing which in spite of all the attentiveness of the mind is perceived indistinctly at first,appears more distinctly later when observed with the strenuous exercise of one's power.

This verse reminds us that the path of yoga is not passive observation. It requires active engagement, a dedicated effort to direct and sustain our awareness. Just as a scientist meticulously observes and experiments to unravel the mysteries of the universe, so toodoes the yogi utilize the power of *spanda* - the divine vibration that animates all of creation - to pierce through the veils of illusion and experience the true nature of reality.

This power of *spanda* is not separate from us; it is our very essence. It is accessed notthrough external rituals or practices, but through the cultivation of *sāvadhāna*, through the sustained intensity of our awareness. The text emphasizes that this state of intensified awareness is not a one-time achievement, but a continuous process, a conscious choice we make in each and every moment.

The rewards ofaligning ourselves with the power of *spanda* are significant, leading to the unfoldment of extraordinary abilities, including *sarvajñatā* - omniscience. The text reveals this connection in verse five (5):

> *anena atiṣṭhite dehe yathā sarvajñatāādaya tathā svātmani atiṣṭhanāt sarvathā aivam abhiṣyāti.* So now they will uhm yogi power is omniscience. *sarvajñatā* Means this all-knowing ability etcetera in respect of the body occurs when it is pervaded by that… Again *anena spanda* principle of the *buddhi* (in bracket). Even so, when the yogi is established in his essential self, he will have omniscience etcetera everywhere.

This verse suggests that when our body and mind are fully imbued with the vibrancy of *spanda*, when we become vessels for this divine energy, we gain access to profound wisdom and knowledge. This omniscience is not merely an accumulation of facts and figures; it is a direct experience of the interconnectedness of all things, a deep understanding of the underlying principles that govern the universe.

However, thetext cautions against complacency. Just as easily as we can access this state of heightened awareness and power, we can also lose it if we are not vigilant. The text warns against *śithila śithilībhāvati* - a slackening of awareness, a loosening of our grip on the reins ofthe mind. This laxity, this forgetting of our true nature, creates an opening for negativity and delusion to creep back in. 

The text utilizes a powerful analogy to illustrate the perils of this spiritual complacency, introducing us to the concept of *jñāni* - a state of lassitude or depression. Verse six (6) paints a stark picture:

> *jñāna-vilunţhikā dehe tasya tasyāśca ajñā ajñānataḥ sthitiḥ tat-unmeṣa-viluptaṁ cet kutas tasya ajñā hetukāt.* Just as a plunderer carries away the valuables of the house, even so depression saps away the vitality of the body. 

This *jñāni*, arising from *unmeṣa-vilupta* - a loss of awareness, a forgetting of our true nature - is compared to acunning thief who stealthily enters our inner sanctuary and robs us of our hard-earned spiritual treasures. This thief is not an external entity; it is the insidious voice of our own complacency, the subtle pull of our old habits and conditioning that whisper, "It's okay to relax, you've done enough."

The consequences of succumbing to *jñāni* are grave. The text warns:

> "This depression proceeds from ignorance. If that ignorance disappears by omniscience, how can that depression last in the absence of its cause?" 

This passage highlights the interconnectedness of awareness, knowledge,and well-being. When we lose our grip on *sāvadhāna*, we create space for ignorance (*ajñāna*) to re-enter our being. This ignorance, this forgetting of our true nature as pure consciousness, manifests as *jñāni* - a state of heaviness,disillusionment, and a loss of *Tāttvika harṣasya* - the essential joy that is our birthright.

### Maintaining Vigilance: A Call to Continuous Awareness

The Spanda Kārikās, through their exploration of *vibhūti*, *sāvadhāna*, andthe perils of *jñāni*, deliver a potent message: the spiritual path is not a destination, but a continuous journey of awakening. It is a call to step into the role of the watchful guardian of our inner treasure house, diligently guarding against any complacency or laxity that might invite the thief of spiritualslumber.

The text reminds us that the attainment of extraordinary powers or even glimpses of liberation are not the end goal; they are merely milestones on a much grander journey. The true measure of our progress lies in the consistency of our practice, the depth of our awareness, and our unwavering commitment to living in alignment withour true nature.

The path of yoga, as outlined in the Spanda Kārikās, is not for the faint of heart. It requires courage to confront our shadows, discipline to maintain our practice, and unwavering *sāvadhāna* to navigate the complexities of the spiritual landscape. Yet, therewards are immeasurable. 

By embracing the principles outlined in the text, by cultivating unwavering awareness, aligning ourselves with the vibrancy of *spanda*, and remaining vigilant against the pitfalls of *jñāni*, we embark on a journey of profound transformation. It is a journey that leads us back to our truenature - a state of unshakeable peace, boundless wisdom, and an overflowing wellspring of *Tāttvika harṣasya* - the essential joy that is our birthright and the ultimate fruit of the yogic path.
