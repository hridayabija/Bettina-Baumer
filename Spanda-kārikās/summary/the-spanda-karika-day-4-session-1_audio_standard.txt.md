##A Deeper Dive into the Journey to *Paramaṁ Padam*

Let's delve deeper into each subtopic, expanding upon the profound insights offered inthe commentary and its related texts:

### The Nature of Senses: Unveiling the *Karaṇeśvarī*

The text uses the evocative imageryof Utpaladeva to highlight the dual nature of our senses. They can be inert and heavy, like "lumps of clay," when confined to ourlimited perception, or they can become vibrant and light, like "feathery fluffs of cotton raised up by the breeze," when animated by the divine.

**1. The Senses in Ordinary Consciousness:**
 - Our everyday experience ischaracterized by a limited sense of self, the *pūryāṣṭaka*, which identifies with the physical, mental, and psychic components of our being.
 - In this state, our senses, bound by the ego, primarily serve to reinforce our separation from the world around us. They act as instruments of desire, feeding our cravings and aversions.

**2. The Awakening of the *Karaṇeśvarī*:**
 - The term *karaṇeśvarī* literally means "the mistress of thesenses." It represents the divine energy or *śakti* that enlivens and guides our senses from within.
 - This animating force is not separate from us but rather a hidden aspect of our true nature, often obscured by our identification with the limited self.

**3. The Practice of *Parīkṣa*:**
 - To awaken the *karaṇeśvarī*, the text emphasizes the importance of *parīkṣa*, a process of careful self-examination and analysis.
 - We are encouraged to observe the movement of our senses - how they engage with the external world, how they withdraw into moments of rest, and how they ultimately dissolve back into the source.
 - This mindful attention helps us disengage from the grip of our senses and recognize the subtler energies at play.

**4. The Transformation of Perception:**
 - As we refine our awareness, our sensesgradually become instruments of heightened perception. They no longer bind us to the limitations of the ego but instead, reveal the interconnectedness of all things.
 - The world, once perceived as separate and fragmented, begins to appear as a unified field of consciousness.

### Reaching the *Paramaṁ Padam*:Transcending Limitations

The text boldly proclaims that the *paramaṁ padam*, the supreme state of liberation, is not a distant goal but a present possibility. This realization forms the cornerstone of *jīvanmukti*, the state of liberation while living.

**1. The Agitation of the Limited Self:**
 - Our ordinary state of being is characterized by *kṣobha*, a constant agitation stemming from the limited self's incessant comparisons and attachments.
 - This agitation is fueled by our identification with impurities (*mala*) and our addiction to actions driven by desire (*karmāt yeṣa abhilāṣinā*).

**2. The Cessation of *Kṣobha*:**
 - The path to *paramaṁ padam* lies in the cessation of this agitation, symbolized by the term *praliyate*, meaning "dissolves" or "merges."- This is not a suppression of thoughts or sensations but a natural consequence of recognizing their illusory nature.

**3. *Bhoga* vs. *Mokṣa*: Choosing the Path of Liberation:**
 - The text distinguishes between two primary goals in spiritual life: *bhoga*, the pursuit of worldly pleasuresand powers, and *mokṣa*, the path of liberation.
 - While *bhoga* may offer temporary gratification, it ultimately keeps us bound to the cycle of desire and suffering.
 - *Mokṣa*, on the other hand, leads to lasting freedom and fulfillment.

**4.The Immediacy of *Jīvanmukti*:**
 - The text challenges the notion that liberation is only attainable after death. It emphasizes that *mokṣa* is a present possibility, achievable through dedicated practice and grace.
 - This concept of *jīvanmukti* offers apowerful message of hope and empowerment, urging us to strive for liberation in this very lifetime.

### The Nature of the Awakened Being: Embracing *Akṛtrimā Dharmā*

The awakened being embodies *akṛtrimā dharmā*, a state of unartificial naturalness characterized by non-worship and the absence of duality. This state is not something to be cultivated but rather a spontaneous expression of one's true nature.

**1. Beyond Artificiality:**
 - *Akṛtrimā* points to a way of being that is effortless, spontaneous, and free from pretense.- It is a state of authenticity where thought, word, and deed are aligned with the deepest truth of one's being.

**2. The Child and the Sage: Reflections of Naturalness:**
 - The text draws parallels between the unconditioned spontaneity of a child and the effortless wisdom of asage.
 - Both embody *akṛtrimā* in their own unique ways, reminding us that this natural state is not something foreign to our being but rather a quality we can rediscover.

**3. *Svatantra*: Perfect Natural Freedom:**
 - *Akṛtrimā*goes hand in hand with *svatantra*, which signifies perfect natural freedom.
 - It is not merely the absence of external constraints but a deeper freedom from the limitations of the ego itself.

**4. Inherent Omniscience and Omnipotence:**
 - The awakened being, establishedin their true nature, naturally expresses *sarvajñatā*, omniscience, and omnipotence.
 - This is not a display of power over others but a reflection of their inherent connection to the source of all knowing and doing.

**5. *Sahaja*: Effortless Being:**- Kṛṣṇamācārya, in his commentary, employs the term *sahaja* to describe the naturalness of the awakened state.
 - *Sahaja* suggests a state of effortless being, where action arises spontaneously from a place of deep inner harmony.

###The Harmony of Knowledge and Action: *Sāmarasya* of *Prakāśa* and *Ānanda*

In the *paramaṁ padam*, knowledge and action are no longer separate functions but rather two sides of the same coin. They merge seamlessly in a state of harmonious union known as*sāmarasya*.

**1. Bridging the Gap:**
 - For the ordinary individual, a gap often exists between what we know and what we do. Our actions are often driven by unconscious impulses, conflicting desires, and societal conditioning.

**2. *Prakāśa* and*Ānanda*: The Essence of Knowledge and Action:**
 - *Prakāśa*, meaning "light" or "illumination," represents the aspect of knowledge in its purest form.
 - *Ānanda*, meaning "bliss" or "joy," represents the inherent fulfillment that accompanies rightaction.

**3. *Sāmarasya*: A Harmonious Unification:**
 - *Sāmarasya* signifies a state of perfect harmony, where *prakāśa* and *ānanda* are inseparable.
 - In this state, knowledge is not merely intellectual but isdeeply felt and embodied. Action flows effortlessly from this place of inner knowing, bringing about a sense of deep fulfillment.

**4. The Integrity of the Awakened Being:**
 - The *jīvanmukta*, established in *sāmarasya*, exhibits a remarkable integrity of being.Their words are a reflection of their actions, and their actions are an expression of their inner truth.

### Wonder and Surprise: *Smayamāna* and the Revelation of *Svabhāva*

The text introduces *smayamāna*, a state of wonder and surprise that arises from directly experiencingone's true nature, *svabhāva*. This is not a fleeting emotion but a profound shift in perception that transforms our relationship with ourselves and the world around us.

**1. Beyond the Mundane:**
 - *Smayamāna* goes beyond our everyday experiences of surprise or amazement. It is a visceral, heart-opening experience that can leave one breathless, akin to witnessing a breathtaking natural wonder.

**2. *Svabhāva*: The Unveiling of True Nature:**
 - The source of this wonder lies in the direct experience of *svabhāva*, ourtrue nature. As we let go of our limited self-identifications, the true nature of our being shines forth, revealing its inherent beauty, luminosity, and perfection.

**3. The Breath and the Dissolution of Thoughts:**
 - The text links *smayamāna* to a specific practice mentionedin the *Vijñānabhairava*, which involves focusing on the breath (*prāṇa*) and dissolving thoughts (*nirvikalpa*).

> "*prajñānaviviśet śaktimayyadvāpavikāsetyā nirvikalpatayā matye tayā bhairavarūpatā*."

> The energy of breath should neither move out nor enter. When the center unfolds by the dissolution of thoughts, then one attains the nature of Bhairava. 

 - When the mind becomes still and centered, free from the distractions of thoughts, the natural state of*bhairavarūpatā* arises—a state of spontaneous centered awareness. This is the very essence of *svabhāva*.

**4. The World Transformed:**
 - When *smayamāna* takes hold, the world is no longer perceived as ordinary or mundane. It is seen anew, infused with a sense of awe, mystery, and profound interconnectedness. 
 - This shift in perception is not merely intellectual; it is a direct, heartfelt experience that transforms our relationship with every aspect of our lives.

### The Lost Tantra: A Mystical Practice ofIntegration and Expansion

The commentary quotes a passage from the *Kakṣyāstantra*, a lost text, to illustrate a powerful mystical practice that leads to the integration of our being and the experience of cosmic unity.

**1. *Sarvaśaktiścitassā*: Directing the Powers of Awareness:**- The practice begins with *sarvaśaktiścitassā*, which can be interpreted as "by the awareness of all the powers." It suggests a state of heightened awareness where the individual recognizes the full potency of their senses and directs them with intention.

**2. Simultaneously Engaging the Senses:**- The yogi then simultaneously engages all their senses, directing them towards their respective objects. This requires immense concentration and focus, as well as a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of sensory experience.

**3. *Sthababhūtas Tiṣṭan*: Remaining Stable Like a GoldPillar:**
 - While the senses are actively engaged, the yogi remains firmly established in the center, symbolized by the image of a gold pillar. This represents an unwavering inner stability, a state of unshakeable centeredness.

**4. *Viśvarūpa Eko'vabhāsi*: Appearing as the Cosmic Form:**
 - Through this intense and unified practice, the yogi's perception expands beyond the limitations of individuality. They experience themselves as *viśvarūpa*, the cosmic form, embodying the entirety of the universe.
 - This echoes Krishna's revelationin the Bhagavad Gita, where he reveals his all-encompassing cosmic form to Arjuna.

### Bhairava Mudra: The Embodiment of Integration

The text connects the previously discussed practices and states to *bhairava mudrā*, a gesture or state of being that symbolizes the complete integration ofthe internal and external aspects of our being.

**1. *Antaḥ Lakṣyo Bahirdṛṣṭi*: The Goal Within, the Gaze Without:**
 - *Bhairava mudrā* is characterized by a unique state of being where the senses remain active in the external world whilethe mind remains firmly focused on the internal goal. 
 - This is captured in the phrase "*antaḥ lakṣyo bahirdṛṣṭi*," which means "the goal within, the gaze without."

**2. Beyond Physical Gestures:**
 - While *mudrās* are often associated with specific hand gestures, *bhairava mudrā* transcends physicality. It represents a state of consciousness where duality is dissolved, and the inner and outer worlds merge seamlessly.

**3. *Adhiṣṭhātrī*: The One Who Presides:**
 - The*yogī* established in *bhairava mudrā* becomes the *adhiṣṭhātrī* of their own being. This term signifies "the one who presides" or "the one who dominates," suggesting a state of mastery over one's internal world. Their actions and perceptions flow froma place of inner authority and freedom, no longer subject to external influences.

### Transcending Duality: The Foundation of Compassion

The analysis culminates with a profound exploration of the awakened being's relationship to others. In the *paramaṁ padam*, where duality dissolves, compassion naturally arises, not asa cultivated virtue but as a spontaneous expression of unity.

**1. Dissolving the Illusion of Separation:**
 - The experience of *paramaṁ padam* shatters the illusion of separation between self and other. Distinctions of high and low, good and evil, cease to hold meaning.**2. The Heart of the *Jīvanmukta*:**
 - The *jīvanmukta*, freed from the confines of the ego, recognizes the inherent unity of all beings. Their compassion is not limited to those they deem worthy but extends to all beings without exception.**3. Ramana Maharshi: "Eliminate the 'I'":**
 - The text invokes the wisdom of Ramana Maharshi, who famously said, "Just eliminate the 'I', and it will happen." This succinct statement encapsulates the essence of true compassion. Whenthe sense of separation dissolves, selfless action arises naturally.

**4. Compassion as a Spontaneous Overflow:**
 - In the *paramaṁ padam*, compassion is not a duty or obligation but a spontaneous overflow of the heart. It is the natural consequence of recognizing the interconnectedness of all beings.### Conclusion: A Journey of Transformation

It is a journey that begins with understanding the nature of our senses, transcends the limitations of the ego, and culminates in the realization of ourtrue nature as pure consciousness.
