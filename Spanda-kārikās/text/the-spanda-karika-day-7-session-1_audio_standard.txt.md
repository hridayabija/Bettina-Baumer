Ok, if we know these three, then the afternoon we can do Paramārthasaṃsthāna. 

This may be not necessary to repeat, but um, as we proceed with the text, I have to stress again that this text is of a very high level of consciousness. It is not for beginners; it is not for ABC of Kashmir Śaivism. And that is why the misunderstandings are easy if you understand it at a certain other level. 

And, uh, what we are aiming at here is to follow the internal logic of the text, try to understand it in its own internal logic, and then connect it with our own practice and our own experience. 

When I thought this in the morning, an image came to my mind. I was observing, you know, in Banaras, for many years, they were building a bridge across the Gaṅgā, uh, dharmagar, and I was seeing for many years, you know, there was from one side they were progressing very slowly and the other side they were progressing, and I was doubting whether they would really meet in the middle.  And then, when they really meet in the middle, you know, it's such a wonderful experience that now, these two ends of the bridge have come together. Not only that, but then the bridge becomes something where you can walk over it. It is then... so that's what the gurus do, you see. They build the bridge, and then we can walk over it. 

But that bridge, we have to build it ourselves, between the knowledge, the text, and the experience, and then come closer and closer and closer, and when we touch, then it is something like *samatkara*. You know, we touched it, um, what the text says is suddenly comes alive in our experience. And this, as we again and again have to say, it's nothing you can make, it happens. You can do many things at the basic level, you can build the pillar and so on and so on, but the actual coming together, the actual, uh, touching, and the image of touching has come again and again. That has to happen, and then you only, *svayamānā*, as they say it. You are just uh overjoyed and overwhelmed by this surprise, like a surprise that the two come together. 

So this is what we are trying to do, because, I'm again saying this, because the text is going at a very high level now. Now why, um and we have - what is the date today? Again? See, I'm also confused. 

So actually, we have three full days, and I have to be careful, of course, to complete the text without hurry. But, uh, maybe if we leave out something we would leave out commentary. But the text, definitely, the kārikās, we will complete them, and we'd take just the essential points from the commentary. So, it means three days full from today. And we have, um maybe this morning we'll try to finish the second *niśānta*, second flow, and start the third in the afternoon. 

Now why, uh Kṣemarāja has divided the kārikās which are actually, originally, not divided, um, and made this second section, because he finds a certain logic of progression that in the first section, it is more a question of internalization of this, uh, going beyond the simply sense perceptions, then to the powers behind the senses, and so on and so on, uh, but it's all in the movement of internalization, *nimīlanasamādhi*. And then, uh the verses which we have started yesterday, they move in the direction of universalization. See, unless we are perfectly internalized, and that is why, um, in the teachings of the text, in a non-meditative environment, uh would be a sin. Just like *Vijñāna Bhairava*, you know, you can teach it in the classroom at the university, but it would be, for me, it would be a terrible thing to go against the spirit of the text if you are not in that kind of meditative, uh, environment. So this, that's why the internalization is the precondition for the universalization. 

But of course, as the kārikā, the kārikās themselves, they show that there is a total continuity because it always connects, uh, *tātparyanikus* back to the previous ones, that means either that state or that *spanda*, which has been described in the previous. So it's a continuity, so only Kṣemarāja, who breaks it up into certain, um, uh, units of, uh, meaning. 

And I am, um, I have to excuse myself to Alexandra and Delidatta, those who are more interested in the textual and, um, scholarly side, because just out of lack of time, you know, I'm not going into the whole question of the *mantramaheśvara*, *mantramaheśvara*, etcetera because then I have to explain so many things, and we cannot proceed. And that is actually, it's only Kṣemarāja. It's not the text itself, the kārikās don't, kārikās only speak of mantra. And the other commentators, they don't understand it in that sense also. 

So we come to verses three and four. 

> yasmad sarvamayo jīvaḥ sarvabhāvasamudbhavaḥ tat saṃvedanarūpeṇa tādātmya pratipattaḥ

It is here tādātmyam.  Ta- ta- is a- I mean, half *ta* is missing. Yeah. 

> tatsaṃvedanarūpeṇa tādātmya pratipattiḥ

Only in the Devanāgarī, you don't have to worry about, in the transcription, it's correct. 

And then comes this - some of this, uh, absolutely famous expressions, which is of course not originally from the *Spanda Kārikā*, but originally from this *svacchandatantra*. 

> tasmāt sattarkaśīntāsu na sāvastānayā śivaḥ 
>
> bhuktaivā bhogyabhāvena sadā sarvatra saṃsthitaḥ

Now in the course of, uh, first of all, we are moving to *advaita*. We are moving to *advaita* of not only the internal and the external, but also the divine and the human, and the limited and the universal. Because if you exclude anything, and that's what then Utpaladeva, he calls very clearly *paramadvaita*. It's not simply *advaita*, it's *paramadvaita* which includes the lower levels. It does not exclude anything, it includes, and it includes therefore the whole question, and what to do with this individuality? Either you have to suppress it, or you have to, uh, deny it, or you have to merge it, or you have to identify it, or, because after all, we are individual beings. 

And here the process is, and that starts actually with Utpaladeva, and I think it marks right, although the idea is also older, I mean, in the Upaniṣads, you find something similar. But I wouldn't say in the Tantra. The Tantra is quite different. That, um, it was Utpaladeva, of course, based on the, uh, *Spanda Kārikā*, and, um, the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. Of course, it's so universal, you find everything and anything in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. You can find even any school of Indian philosophy in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. Uh, and if you take them individually as an individual practice, you can take it and apply it to some different school. 

So if there is a logical connection when he says *yasmat*. And what is the, uh, preceding? What is preceding? He was talking, of course, of the mantras. And mantras, and this I have to add to what we discussed yesterday about mantra. It is not a new invention of the Tantra. This is a very old idea that mantras are not just words, mantras are divinities. And that is right from the Veda, and, uh, mantras themselves are the divinities. And that is why they are also personified. And, um, so it was connecting that the mantras, they merge, and they become absolutely peaceful, *śānta*, *upanirānta*, and, um, pure, and together with the mind of the practitioner they merge there, and they are of the nature of Śiva.  Means, they are themselves of divine nature, together with the mind of the practitioner, *ārādhaka*, they are of divine nature. Which means that by practicing *mantra* in this way, the process of divinization takes place. So *mantra* and the mind of the *yogī*, become one and they become one and become transformed into the divine. The process of divinization. And if you don't understand this, then the next verse would be totally, um, wrongly understood. 

And that is the logical connection when he says *yasmat*.  Then um *jīva*. It is explicitly stated: the individual being. Because, sorry that's not it, because the individual uh being is *sarvamaya*, is universal. So here that identification uh is already made: is *sarvamaya* means is universal. And we had before also, I mean the whole connection of microcosm, macrocosm, microcosm that and which is an old story in uh in the Indian tradition. Whatever is in the body is in the universe and then that uh even the individual itself is *sarvamaya*, it is universal. And this expression of course corresponds philosophically perfectly to the idea: *sarvaṃ sarvātmakam* means everything is of the nature of the totality. So every individual being also, e- every uh not only individual human being but every blade of grass, every um grain of sand is of the nature of the totality. So this *sarvaṃ sarvātmakam*, everything is connected with everything else and united with everything else. Here it is applied to the *jīva*, and that's the most difficult thing because the greatest obstacle to this universal uh feeling or universal uh identification is the individual. 

But he goes on: *sarvabhāvasamudbhavat*. Because everything uh originates from it, from... Okay, let us read the translation, even if it is a little digressive, since the limited individual self is identical with the whole universe inasmuch as all entities arise from him and because of the knowledge of all subjects he has the feeling of identity with them - *tadātmya pratipattitaḥ*. With them all. Hence, and that is the next verse, he has the feeling of identity with them all. 

*tadātmya prati*, *tad* - *sambandhobhena tadātmya pratipattitaḥ*. Now let us stop here for a moment and go back to the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. 

Um, see, the one question which is always asked is: is this all a selfish search for *mukti*, and we are just only uh trying to liberate ourselves and don't bother about the rest? But it's just the opposite. And the example or the practice given in the *Vijñāna Bhairava* corresponding to this is precisely the basis for compassion. And now I have to, I am opening a new step. One should experience the consciousness also in the body of others as in one's own. Giving up the concern for one's own body one becomes all-pervading within these. 

And there is another one. Which verse? Huh? Which one? 

Verse 107. Um, and there is one more in the same direction. This, this is uh verse 100 is also similar, but um, it's not exactly what I mean. This one speaks, this is important because otherwise uh we don't understand the practical implications. But 100 is uh a little different, but um still connected, the one who, which is characterized: this consciousness is residing in all the bodies, there is no differentiation, anything. Therefore if a person realizes that everything is full of that, he conquers the world of becoming. 

But it's more directly um directed to other people. Anyhow, let it come. Anyhow, I promised I'll give it to you, but at the moment I'm not finding. But uh you know, the the group of *dharanas* uh which are connected with that consciousness which we experience in ourselves and in the others um as uh one and overcoming of duality. *tadātmya pratipattitaḥ*, *pratipatti* means perception or ascertainment. And then the second was: 

> tasmāt sarvatra citsatsu na sarvāstā na yā śivaḥ

Therefore whether in word, in the object or in thought, there is no state which is not Śiva. And the, I hope that's symbolic, is the source is actually in this *spandanatāntra*. He doesn't give. 

> bhoktāiva bhogya-praveṇa satā sarvatra saṃsthitaḥ

It is the experiencer himself who always and everywhere abides in the form of the experienced and then that is in bracket, to be put in bracket. It is the divine himself who is the essential experience and it is he who abides in the form of the universe as his field of experience. 

So it's the overcoming of the duality of subject and object. And which we had in the *Vijñāna Bhairava* again, this famous verse that um the knowledge of or awareness of subject and object is common to all living beings but the specific nature of the *yogīs* is to be aware of the relation. And relation means also of the unity, *samanveṣa sadātanatā*, to be aware of the unity of both. And here this is what he is trying to achieve. 

This *mātsa śabdārtha-citsatsu na sarvāstā na yā śivaḥ*. *Bhoktāiva bhogya-praveṇa satā sarvatra saṃsthitaḥ*. 

Now let me see Mark's translation. Um, everything arises out of the individual soul and so he is all things because he perceives his identity with the awareness he has of them. Therefore there is no state in the thoughts or words or their meanings that is not Śiva. It is the enjoyer alone who always and everywhere abides as the object of enjoyment. 

Now this whole question of uh the identification of the limited individual with the universal or with Śiva um is a topic which engages Utpaladeva both in his *Śivastotrāvalī* and in his um *Iśvarapratyabhijñā* uh kārikā. And uh in the *Śivastotrāvalī* it's in the way of poetry and uh spontaneous uh expression where, for example, the worst thing, worst obstacle for uh *yogī* is *abhimāna*, means to consider the ego the most important. 

But he has a verse on *abhimāna* that even *abhimāna* um is uh if you realize the true *abhimāna* that is pride or ego. And in the *Śivastotrāvalī* 93: 

> O Lord, you are the sole cause of all worldly egos. When shall I attain that great ego filled with the bliss of your love? *mahābhimāna mahābhimānakariśyaṃ tad-bhakti-rasāsvāditaḥ*.

So we cannot deny it, see, everybody has an *abhimāna*. Even the two dogs are fighting, they also have their *abhimāna*. But how to deal with it? How to transform it? How to uh pierce through it? Not to throw it away, because throwing away would be impossible. And the psychologists know that it's impossible now. It's only a question: how to uh understand it and how to deal with it? 

And of course, he has many uh verses um where he describes the transformation of the individual feeling into the universal as in that one beautiful verse of the *Saṃghrahastotra*:

>  *yo vikalpa-nidamanmatha-maṇḍalaṃ paśyati śaṃ nikhilaṃ bhavatvapuḥ svātmapakṣaparipūritajagat yasya nitya-sukhanakutūhalayam*. 

He who perceives this whole universe of objects in a thought-free state as your divine body and who fills the world with his own self - *svātmapakṣa* - he is ever blissful whence the fear. 

So this *svātmapakṣaparipūritajagat*. A first condition, he is *vikalpa* and that was uh if you take the first mission of the first section of the kārikās as um a way to reach that state of *nirvikalpa* and *antaḥmukhatā*, internalization etcetera. And that is the condition for being able to universalize. Otherwise, if you remain in your limited uh ego, there is no question of universalizing, of identifying with uh with everything and everybody, that it's just not possible psychologically. So it's only in the state of *nirvikalpa*. So there are many passages in the *Śivastotrāvalī* where he shows that transformation, I think, of the limited ego to the universal. 

And then uh Kṣemarāja begins his commentary.

> *yatho jīvo grāhakaḥ sarvamayaḥ śivavat svarūpaḥ*. 

Because uh the logical connection of this universalization is, the thing is purely subjectivity because the *jīva* is the subject, and therefore he is like Śiva, *Śivavat viśvarūpa* and *sarvamaya*. In as far as he is uh pure subjectivity - the question about the purity of course that is a question of *vikalpa*, *nirvikalpa* etc., - but as far as he is a pure subject, he is like Śiva who is *sarvamaya*, universal, and *viśvarūpa*, who has universal form. And for that reason, *tena hetunā śaktiśūbhat*, and in, in words in um the meanings and in the things, there is no, no other state but Śiva, *cintāsu*, and even in thoughts, *vikalpajñānādirūpāsu*. So even in *vikalpas*, *cintā* means *vikalpa*, *ādi madhya antarūpā sāvasthā nāsti yā śivāt*. There is no state which is not Śiva, whether in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. And that refers to the previous uh description that uh the *suddhabhūta*, he has this awareness not only beginning and end, but also in the middle whereas the not fully enlightened one, he has the awareness only at the beginning and the end of some states. Uh, in the translation, page 170 um is summarized somehow: Since this teaching begins with *jīva* and ends with Śiva, it teaches by way of suggestion that there.

>  *Thavat saṃvidhi durlabhā*

It is difficult to attain. 

> *kascit cit ive na nija saṃvit unmeṣa nimeṣābhyāṃ śrījan* 

Now we come back to our first verse, *nime*, *unmeṣa*, *nimeṣa*, which is, it's not only the activity of Śiva, it's the activity of the liberated soul, of the *jīvanmukta*. And *unmeṣa* means he, that awakening. And *unmeṣa*, *nimeṣa*, even in the case of the *jīvanmukta*, means that creating and dissolving. And then it goes back, it unless may *ive mai āveśāt mano yemāṃ nitya-yuktā upāsate*. I think he has already quoted this before, having mentally entered into me, those who are always united with me and wait upon me. He is entirely, bondage is burnt to ashes by the fire of spiritual knowledge, and after the fall of the body, he abides in Śiva himself. 

And now he comes to:

> *na saṃśayaḥ* 

He ends this statement about *jīvanmukti* *ive*. There is no doubt, *na saṃśayaḥ*. And this *na saṃśayaḥ*, he uh interprets in the sense of *dīkṣā*. This is interesting, initiation. 

> *Ity anena Idam tanayati*

He hints at *dīkṣādinā gurupatayatā muktiḥ*. Set the normal way of liberation is by initiation and from the guru by the um faith, or *patyaya* can be also faith, in the guru there is liberation.  

> *Itriśataḥ tu jñānāt*. 

See, there are the three ways of getting uh liberation: by initiation from the guru and by knowledge alone, *jñānāt svapratyayāt svapratyayāt*. 

And we are coming back to the same thing which we had um always um heard before, that uh liberation can be attained by, or knowledge can be attained by the *āgama*, by the um tradition, or by the text, by the guru, and by one's own experience, *sva-anubhavaḥ svapratyayā*. 

And of course, ideally the three combine. Ideally. But even if you don't have a guru or if you don't have the *śāstra*, you can still experience that yourself. And of course, it, everything is a, is a creative process. I mean, the tradition doesn't live with a very single uh track, you know, tradition means always combining these three. And sometimes you may be fortunate to meet uh a guru, of course, that is the greatest fortune and, and once, not only one life, so many lives. Uh, but um even if that is not the case, and you have some experience and then you come across some text like *Vijñāna Bhairava* and suddenly we understand something and so. So it's all the process. And then again, you meet somebody who confirms that yes, your experience is right. Uh, so it is all the process, it's not only one track, uh. But he says definitely that he has to say because in the whole of Śaivism, *dīkṣā* is the condition for liberation. Especially in the dualistic Śaivism, without *dīkṣā* you can't get *mukti*. 

Yeah. Yeah. This sounds that we'll have to go back to that verse. 

Doesn't mean that the *milanāt samādhi* is not a necessary precondition for these? Means that he's given in the first section for, for somebody who are not liberated, for instance? 

No, no, good. And is, is that whole internalization of consciousness is a necessary precondition for universalization? 

Yeah, it is. It is. So despite this, or because it's a little bit because the author means suggests that the means of the of the *milanāt samādhi* described in the first section is optional? Uh, see that, that uh we have seen before that this internalization, *milanāt samādhi*, it does not mean only that you have to spend many years in sitting in *samādhi*, but it can happen in a moment. And that is why this article, you know, this uh getting into an intense state, it brings you uh internalizes you in, in one moment. Uh, and then that moment of course can be extended in in *samādhi* or in, in practice. 

Maybe the problem is optional. Mm? Optional. Optional is right translate. 

But to see *vā*. It is often wrongly translated. *vā* does not only mean optional. *vā* means also and. Yeah, um, so it's uh often it is um uh it is a very Western way of thinking, either it has to be this or it has to be that. No, if *vā* means precisely um it can be um or it, uh, both. 

You can look in the dictionary: both. Both. 

But the thing is, even from the first verse, I don't see how you could interpret that way, because in the first verse, it says that you have both. So how could you take it at this point that it's optional? We contradict what's said in the first, in the first verse. You mean the uh? 

Yes, *unmeṣa nimeṣābhyāṃ*. The first verse. Very first verse. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it's already included. It's already included. 

Well, could you you just use the expression "creative process." Mm-hmm. You use the expression "creative process." Could you just elaborate on it a little more? Creative process? 

Yeah. 

Does the creative process refer only to the merging of the *nimīlana* and *unmīlana*? Or if we were to look at it in as an empirical individual, what you create in the microcosm. Can I interpret it that way? 

You see that *nimīlana* has at some point has to lead to the *unmīlana*. So in that sense, it is uh it's not a choice, it's a matter of the development of the inner development, and uh but ultimately it has to lead to *unmīlana*. You cannot exclude um uh the only difference is uh how uh stable is your state. Both *nimīlana* and *unmīlana*. The, the stability of the state and that, that makes the whole difference between the *apavitra*, *śuddha*, *aśuddha*, *aśuddhāpavitra*, and *śuddhāśuddha*, and ultimately of course the *jīvanmukta*. 

So what uh is here? 

>*sarvasya etad advaya- patā lakṣaṇatvāt*

See uh the page 122, Sanskrit line four, *sarvasya etad advaya-patā lakṣaṇatvāt*. 

Because the, it, the whole thing is a question of realizing the uh state of non-duality, of everything. *Sarvasya etad advaya-patā*. 

We've not started this verse yet, no? We haven't started this verse yet. This is verse six and seven. 

No, no, I meant the commentary. I, I, I'm sorry. I'm going too far, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm going too far. 

This is, we ended uh the commentary in verse five by saying that it is um *dīkṣā*, *guru-patyayā*, or one's own knowledge. Sorry. Now we are coming to, are we still able to concentrate with two more verses? 

Yeah. 

>*imeva mahā-samāpatti-sādhakācāryādināṃ adīnām āveśāt prāpteḥ eva*. 

This great realization is the means of the attainment of the desired object of all the *sādhakas* and the *ācāryas*. *mahā-samāpatti*. He is very conversant with uh Yoga terminology. *Samāpatti* is a very specific um in Yoga. 

Okay, Alexander: *samāpatti*, *mahā-samāpatti*. *Samāpatti* is the totally integrated state, but *mahā-samāpatti* is even higher than that. Great realization is the... 

No, but Krishna: is it *mahā-samāpatti*? Or is it that *ātma-samāpatti*? It doesn't say *mahā-samāpatti*.

No, I am talking of the introduction to verses six and seven, the little, I have little introduction to verse six and seven. Yeah. 

>*Iyam eva udayastasya tasya jāyā cittasī tadātmatā-samāpattir icchatā sādhakasyā vā*. 
>*Iyam evāmṛta-prāptir iyam evātma-yogaḥ iyam evānantā dīkṣā ca śiva-sad-bhāvā-lādayinī*. 

This is beautiful. He's really uh at a very highest state. And he connects now all these concepts: *udaya*. Now *udaya*, that rising. And you remember in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*, at the end of some of the *dharanas*, he often says, "If you do, if you do this, this, this, this: *mahā-udaya*." Then the great arising will happen, the great um awakening, a great arising, *mahā-udaya*. So *udaya*. 

*Tasya jāyā cittasī*. This only is the manifestation of the object of meditation in the meditator's mind, that the aspirant with resolute will has the realization of his identity with that object of meditation. *Tadāt tadātmatā-samāptir icchatā sādhakasyā vā*. 

Now the object of, I mean the, the aim of any meditation is to become one with the object of meditation. *Tattvānāṁ teyaḥ*, that difference between *tattva*, the meditator, the meditation, and the object of meditation, that difference has to be resolved, has to disappear. And as long as uh our meditation is incomplete, if we still see something, "Now I am meditating and now I am thinking on this." So the duality uh is still there, that is not real meditation. So *dhyātā*, *dhyeya*, *dhyeyaṁ*, and *dhyānaṁ*. Or *dhyāyin*, that means also the meditator. *Dhyāyī cetasī*. In the mind of the meditator. This is the rise of the object of meditation. *Udayaḥ*. Which is *samapatti*. It's a unification, you know, many of the um so difficult to translate the subtle difference between these words related to Yoga practice, like *samapatti* and uh and *anusantāna*. They, they all mean this unification. 

Um yeah, I mean unification I think is *samapatti*. *Tadātmā samapattiḥ icchatāḥ*. Now uh you know if we translate it in English, then we could translate *icchā* by, by will. But if we again we translate *icchā* in a different way because we have seen that the four *upayas*, the highest *upaya*, apart from the non-means that is uh beyond anything, the highest *upaya* is purely *icchā*. And *icchā* means not my individual will, but *icchā* means just that impulse to... That's why *uttamopayo icchā*. That, that um that push or that um *elan*, as Silburn says, um that there is nothing else. There is no *kriyā*, there's no *jñāna*, there's no *bhakti*. And that is *śāmbhava upaya*. That is pure *śāmbhava upaya* where your guru was in that state.  Muktinath says: *Shambhavaḥ sthā*. So there is still um some push. That's why it's *uttamopayo icchā*, etc. 

So if you see that this only is a manifestation of the, of the manifestation in *udayaḥ*. The rising of the object of meditation in the meditator's mind, that the aspirant with resolute will has the realization of his identity with that. So resolute will, I mean it can be very misunderstood in uh terms of individual consciousness. But here we are already at the level of universal consciousness. So that *icchā* has another power, it's not our individual will. And then this is beautiful, what is the outcome of that unifying meditation, totally unifying meditation. 

*Iyamevā amṛtaprāptiḥ*. This is the attainment of the pure blissful nectar. *Ayam ātmānugrahaḥ*. This is the attainment of the Self. And this is the *Nirvāṇadīkṣā*. *Nirvāṇadīkṣā Śivātattva-pradāyinī*. Which leads to the true identity with Śiva. *Nirvāṇadīkṣā*, which leads to the nature, the divine nature. *Śivātattva-pradāyinī*. Which bestows the divine nature. 

Now, *Nirvāṇadīkṣā* is one of the levels. We have been talking a little bit about initiation, but not very much. Uh, *Nirvāṇadīkṣā* is, apart from *ācāryadīkṣā*, because *ācāryadīkṣā* is the initiation of a master. So that is only given in very rare cases. But otherwise, *Nirvāṇadīkṣā* is the highest, that is given to the disciples who only desire *mukti* and not *bhukti*. Not who don't want um um extraordinary powers or um enjoyments in this or in the other world. So *Nirvāṇadīkṣā* is the highest, highest. The *dīkṣā*... the *dīkṣā* leading to complete liberation. This indeed, uh... Now I'm reading um Mark these two verses. 

This indeed is the arising of the object of meditation in the mind of the meditator, namely the adept's realization of his identity with it by the force of his intent. And we have this beautiful title of the um foundation underlying this *vibhāga*. Citta's intent. So intent is uh also good uh word for *icchā*. This alone is the attainment of the nectar of immortality. This indeed is to catch hold of oneself. It's a bit, a bit I don't like that. This is the initiation of Nirvāṇa, which bestows Śiva's true nature. *Śivattva-pradāyinī*. 

Intent is also read as *saṁkalpa*. *Saṁkalpa*, intent. Very *saṁkalpa*. The intent can be the same. Intent, intent, *saṁkalpa*. Yes, of course, of course. Yeah. But *icchā* is different. *Icchā* and *saṁkalpa* are different. In that sense, yeah. It be- so uh he identifies the, the experience of unification of the meditator with the object of meditation with the *Nirvāṇadīkṣā*. It does not mean that you have to undergo the *Nirvāṇadīkṣā* in the ritual sense, but he refers back to all the, all the Śaiva Āgamas. They describe at great length these different kinds of *dīkṣā*, starting from the *Tantra*- *Tantra-loka*. 

From? *Tantra-loka*. Uh, no, no, no. *Tantra-loka*. No, no. The Tantras themselves. 

Yeah. 

No, but which are the grades of *dīkṣā*? It starts from *samaya*. *Samayadīkṣā*, *putrakadīkṣā*, *Nirvāṇadīkṣā*, and *ācāryadīkṣā*. *Samayadīkṣā* is given to uh disciples who want just to have an entrance into the tradition and to be allowed and authorized to perform the rituals. And that is practically limited to Shaiva Siddhānta. It is not, not at all necessary in Kashmiri Shaivism. 

*Putrakadīkṣā* is uh... *Putrakadīkṣā* is, you can call it "initiation of the spiritual sons." And uh, so it is more that intimacy between guru and disciple, that's from the expression itself that one has to do. It's a stage higher. Now *Nirvāṇadīkṣā* is the highest, apart from *ācāryadīkṣā*, which is as I said, which is rare and only given to the master who has to continue the tradition and the teaching, etc. 

So *samaya*, *putrakācārya>*nirvāṇa*. 

Yeah, *samaya*. *Samaya*. 

Yeah. *Samaya*, *putrakācārya*, uh, and the *Nirvāṇadīkṣā*. Yeah. *Nirvāṇa*. Yeah. 

I wanted to make a comment here. I've been suppressing myself, restraining myself for the last few days. For a tradition that recognizes *Shakti*, or the feminine aspect, and you mentioned the *Devīmahātmya* where the grammar is feminine, what I find, you know, the language just now put through something and the pronouns are all masculine. 

That's only in the translation. That's only in the translation. You see the language uh is only in the translation. It, *putrika* can be heir, not necessarily son. 

But when you translated it, *putrika* was son, and not heir, and the pronouns are always "he."

But this is uh I mean, see I also I also don't agree with this feminist, so all the time "he", "she", I mean I find it so artificial. And, and ultimately, a human being is the same, so why do we have to make all this kind of linguistic, uh, I mean for me, I am a woman, but I don't feel offended if I say that *jīvanmukta* is a man. He's also a woman. That I don't feel any difficulty. 

So otherwise, the language becomes so artificial. All these American scholars who translate these texts, you know, it's always "he", "she", and uh um I, I... it's too much. 

Even I had the same uh feeling about feminism, but anyway, it's just another barrier, isn't it? If you always identify with the "she" also, it's just another, it's just another concept which is holding you back from being a person. Isn't it?

Precisely. Holding up.

No, if you are um forever trying to balance out the "he" and "she", it's another thing which is just something you step over and you become a person. 

What I'm, just agreeing with what you're saying.

That's right. And I keep wondering why uh like, you know, such an effort into balancing the male, female, male, female. Uh, but is it a balance what we're trying to achieve if you consider uh your, your being? 

You're also a person, no? Essentially you're a person. 

Yeah, the balance is beyond. You see, if you uh I I my, you see my mother tongue is German. See if I speak in German, it will be feminine, because "person" in German is feminine. So everything will be feminine. It also depends on the language. 

It is. They is an alternative. Use neither he or she. 

But if you're happy then uh uh you are welcome to correct uh the trans-

No, no, no, I'm too small a person to edit or correct anything that's said here. It is just a comment. What is the word *mukta* in Sanskrit? What is the word used? 

Which one? *Jivanmukta* was of course. *Jivanmukta* the, the uh grammatically is masculine, but um um I mean how would they have to express uh *jivanmukta* as a... But uh the... it would be... see, according to traditional usages, the grammatically masculine would include the feminine, but not the other way around. See, if you say "jivanmukta," then then the men will protest. Then they will say, "They are not included." Yeah. Um, but if you look at the entire um philosophy, you know, it, everything depends on *Shakti*. So if you do not realize that, if you want divine feminine power, then you cannot reach even up to that stage of uh realization. So without *Shakti* and um it is from the beginning, *Shakti chakra*. Without this realization of the *Shakti chakra*, you know that whole understanding is not possible. And *Shakti*, who is it? *Citkānā kaliyā*, who is *svātantrya*, who is uh uh *parā*, the supreme uh *Shakti*, etc. So it's mostly, it's a problem of translation, but um as I said, modern translators, they will do it uh differently. 

Let us complete this section by just some selection from the commentary. Yeah, he refers, he starts by referring to the famous dictum, and he does include all the Śaiva Āgama um uh basic uh principles of the Śaiva Āgamas. 

And one of the basic principles of the Śaiva Āgamas is that *šivibhūtaṁ śivaṁ yajet*. You cannot worship Śiva without becoming Śiva. And that is a basic principle for every, even *sādhaka*, every devotee who is doing any *pūjā* in the temple, um, he has to transform his body first into a divine body. And that's the whole process. If you take it in the ritual sense, the process of *pūjā sthiti* and um also burning the physical body and building up the spiritual body, *śaktidēhā*, the body of ener- and then only after this whole process, ah, then only you are able to worship, to the ritual worship. 

So it starts by referring to that one should worship Śiva by becoming Śiva, which is already um contained in, even in the dualistic Āgamas. But then here, we are going, of course, one step further, that there is no state which is not Śiva. So that you don't even have to go through this ritual process of *pūjā* etc., because if you have already that realization that there is no state, including the body and the mind, which is not Śiva. Because:

> *viśvaśarīra citānandaghanaḥ śiva iti*. 

So who is Śiva? Śiva is He whose body is the universe as an intensity of consciousness and bliss. 

> *viśvaśarīra citānandaghanaḥ śivaḥ*. 

Śiva means... Śiva means the, the unity, dense unity of consciousness and bliss being the universal body, *viśvaśarīra*. 

Yeah, that is what I was jumping before: *sarvat sarvasyaitat advaitabhāvalagnatvāt*. Because of, of attaining the realization of non-duality. 

And then it quotes *śāstrotpādali* um one four:

> *sākṣāt brahmamayamātra sarvasmin bhuvanāntare kim apākṣimatāṃ kṣetram atra kva ca śāsanā siddhyati*

When everything in the world is in your form, how could there be a place not suitable for devotees? Where in the world does the mantra fail to bear fruit? 

Etc. means a place of pilgrimage, sacred place. So which is that place anywhere in the world which is not sacred? And which is the mantra which does not bear fruit? Which does not yield its result? 

> *sākṣāt brahma mayamātra*. 

Because everything is of your nature directly. *sākṣāt brahmamayamātra sarvasmin bhuvanāntare*. In this whole universe, um. But here is done in a different way. 

"Oh Lord, in this whole world which is thy own manifest form, what is that spot which is not a holy place for the devotees? And where the mantras of these devotees will not bear fruit?" 

And this is this realization:

> *samapadi brahma advayārūpasya amṛtatsya prāptiḥ hi*. 

This is the attainment of the ambrosia of the non-dual realization of the non-dual form, highest non-duality, *brahmādvaita*. 

And then um we come to this *nirvāṇadīkṣā*, but interestingly, he ah quotes this *Vācātanatantra*, which is a um critical of the Vedāntic understanding of *ātman*, comes very close: 

> *ta ātmopāsakasarve na gacchanti paraṃ padam*.

The worshippers of the self do not reach the highest state. And this is *Vācātanatantra*. It's not any philosophical text. 

But then he comes to this *nirvāṇadīkṣā*, where he quotes my favourite text, that is *Paratriśikā*. *Paratriśikā*. Somebody has stolen?

The context is the identification of the ritual initiation with a purely spiritual ah process. Ah, spiritual in the sense of substituting ritual by knowledge. And the, there are different acts of ritual ah spiritualized. And immediately preceding that is that verse which we have already got, that in, as the ah in the seed of the banyan tree, in potency, the whole tree is contained. In the same way, in the seed of the heart, *hṛdayabijasya*, this ah whole um ah living and ah immobile universe is contained. And the seed of the heart is the mantra. And then immediately after that - even you quoted that -

> *dvīnātasyā nirvāṇagāminīdīkṣā bhavatyasaṃdigdhatilādyāhutivacanāt*

He who knows in reality - means in that non-dual way - his initiation, he has that initiation of liberation. So without performing all these rituals, without any doubt, and without offering ah season and ah key into the fire, *tilādyāhutivacanāt*. And then, of course, Abhinavagupta has, and um... Well, they, they identified it with what? 

Yeah, but this scholar... 

Okay, now I know many people, the Buddhists are really prominent there. No, they, they identify what? Huh? The Buddhist also identify with what? 

What? 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, but this is the general opinion now. No, I know in Orissa ah there are some ah people who defend that Orissa was the original *Oḍḍiyāna* ah because also the name, and then you have many uh names in Orissa which are connected with, with the, for example, Macchendranāth, Macchen- nāth is very much present there, and um so they have developed some theories on that. It should be in eastern India. But I think I have no other ah basis for debating that scholar opinion.
