So, I was hoping that Krishna would give me some today, but uh, if you know the *Bhagavad Gītā*, He says very clearly that “I never rest.” So, even it was a kind of reaction against the kind of yoga – you know – of total, as we have discussed before, inactivity, and that's why he says, “I myself never rest, so the beings also never rest.” But um, what is his um closest definition of yoga in the *Gītā*? *Karma-sukauśalaṁ*: Skillfulness in action. 

And uh, it's from one of the most beautiful definitions of yoga. And *Kauśalaṁ* of course in in uh Buddhism also it has a very important uh significance, but it means *kuśalaḥ kauśalaṁ.* It's uh not just skillfulness like a like a um any worker is uh able to do his work, but it means something beneficial and liberating and action which is *kuśalaḥ* is is liberating is a salvific action and um beneficial action. So, *karma-sukauśalaṁ.* 

So, in that sense, we're celebrating *Janmāṣṭamī* also by honoring his definition of yoga. And I I would suggest, if you don't mind, to have the afternoon free, at least in that way, whether it's raining or not raining, it doesn't matter, but have the afternoon free, so I can also go to the doctor's.

Uh, now uh, what is so wonderful in this tradition, and it again and again happens to me and to others spontaneously, that you study something, then you experience something, then you read something else, and suddenly all these things come together and uh and complement each other and explain each other, and it was not intended. You know, yesterday, when I read this uh peace by the Anonymous Guru about *mantra*, and in the evening we heard Swamiji on *mantra*. And today the same topic is coming up in the text, and it's not that I have planned it like this. But it just happens.

And uh maybe for those who are not so familiar with the tradition, I should um repeat or revise a little bit what we have heard last evening uh. If you, I think it would be useful. So that the *mantra* is still there. And uh he starts explaining a verse on addressed to Gaṇeśa um as an Gaṇeśa with the uh the whole symbolism of the nine doors. Huh? A city. I'm not uh. Uh that no no that verse on Gaṇeśa is uh the different place. This um *Oṁ to sa* and the explanation is on page 21, but the Gaṇeśa *mantra* is somewhere else. So, I'm not even sure, it must be from the um. So, yes. Let me give you the background.

That there are different *Tantras* in Kashmiri Shaivism which are very popular and authoritative. And among them, and each *Tantra* has its own *mantra*. Its own deity and its own *mantra*. Now, the *Tantra* from which this *mantra* is taken is *Netra Tantra*. So, *Netra Tantra*, of course, it means the eye. And eye in relation to Śiva, of course, means the third eye. And the Lord of the deity, the form of Śiva uh worshipped in that *Tantra* is called *Aghoranetra Natha*, the Lord of the third eye, or *Amṛteśvara Bhairava*, the Lord of immortality.

And uh as we had heard on the first day his holiness reciting the *Mahāmṛtyuñjaya Mantra*, of course uh that is also addressed to Śiva as overcoming of death, Overcomer of death. And *Amṛteśvara Bhairava* is another form of Śiva as the Lord of immortality, means the one who overcomes death. And uh there is a beautiful symbolism, of course, our old, ever the same Kṣemarāja, he gives a beautiful commentary on the *Netra Tantra*, where he goes into the whole symbolism of the eye uh with analyzing all the parts of the physical eye and giving it esoteric significance. It's a beautiful passage. Jaṁspal has translated that um.

So, *Netra* is taken in its um full uh symbolic sense. And then uh the *mantra* revealed in the *Netra Tantra* is what we have heard yesterday, but you will not find it anywhere in the *Tantra*. It is only indicated. And this is in all the *Tantras*, the *mantra* is never expressed, it is just hinted. So, you get a a hint um and um and you have to derive it. So, either you are in the tradition and then you are able to uh uncode, as we have all these computer codes, um uh and uh the *Tantras* have their own code language, and then you can uncode this code, or you have to have a master who is in the tradition and who does it for you. 

Of course, *ājkal*, nowadays we have all texts and published uh works and things are already explained and so on, but originally, it is all hidden. So, you will not find that *mantra* anywhere in the *Netra Tantra* except by hints. 

And um then as Swamiji has done, he always made us recite the *mantra* with explanation. And his approach to *mantra* was always uh one that *mantras* have meaning. Because there was a lot of discussion, even among scholars, you know, in, “Are *mantras* meaningless and are just some um abracadabra, some syllables which uh don't mean anything and have some magic?” and so on. But Swamiji was always insisting *mantras* have meaning, and it may not be a lexical meaning, but uh they have meaning. And that is why he gave a lot of importance to the explanation of each syllable and each uh word of the *mantra*. 

So, the uh the already the explanation of *Oṁ* is of course a universal uh *bīja mantra*, which is used in all the Indian traditions and given different meanings. Like in the Vedic, Upanishadic *Oṁ* is given another meaning, and here in the Shaiva it's given another meaning, but they are not contradictory, they're just complementary. And uh the the meaning of *Oṁ* is uh so beautiful. It is that great reality, *Śivadhāma,* which is the *dhāma* means both the abode and also the the reality of the, the Shaiva reality, Śiva's reality – luminous. *Dhāma* is always something luminous. In which uh, which which is full of, which is uh, dance with consciousness and bliss, *citānandakaṇā*, and in which all the elements of the universe are merged, *antarāliṅa*. That's why we always when we start this uh reciting with this explanation, *antarāliṅa tad brahma*. You know, that reducing the whole multiplicity of the entire universe in one syllable, then this is the *Oṁ. Antarāliṅa tad brahma*. Um, this is the that total uh all-embracing uh nature of that one uh syllable, *Oṁ*.

Then *Jum* and uh repeat the last line. 

Dance with consciousness and bliss, dance of consciousness and bliss, *citānandakaṇā* uh this, yeah.

And then, *yattattvaṁ śivadhāmakam*, that that reality which is the uh abode of Śiva or the *dhāman,* the light-filled presence of Śiva, you can also say that, is called *Oṁ*.

And *Jum* um of course, many of these *bīja* uh *mantras*, you find them again in Tibetan Buddhism and uh very far, even up to Japan. Some of the uh Sanskrit *bīja man- bīja akṣaras*, even that uh *lipi*, that script, you know, that *siddhaṁ*. The the calligraphy, yeah, this location, there, he has collected um uh these Japanese calligraphy. Yeah um yeah. 

But even of the Sanskrit *mantra*, the *siddhaṁ* script.

So, these uh *mantras*, these *bīja,* *siddhaṁ* script, we have it. Yeah, this in front of the gate, outside. Yeah, outside, outside. Uh-huh, yeah yeah, door. Yeah.

So, the beautiful Japanese calligraphy which uh uh that kind of calligraphy you don't find in India, but the same *mantras,* same *bījas* uh so they have traveled very far. Tremendous um influence.

And on the side of the temple, on the side of the temple uh there are uh. Yeah, of course, of course. And that these are these uh compacted uh uh *mantras*. 

So that *siddhaṁ* script uh has transported those uh *mantras*. 

So, *Jum* is also one of those *bīja akṣara bīja mantras* which um in uh originally, it denotes the *Śakti*. And that energy, that *akṣara Paramā Śālinī*, who is capable of self-reflection. So, this is again what we have said about *Vimarsha*. That the ultimate reality is not only *Prakāśa*. It's also *Vimarsha*. And *Vimarsha* is *Śakti*, and *Vimarsha* means *Amṛta* uh *Paramā Śālinī*. She who is capable of self-reflection. And who is, who is free from the limitations of space, time, form, etcetera. *Deśa kāla atīta saccidānandakaṇādidhi*.

And then um *Oṁ Jum Saha* again means an aspect uh of *Śakti*, or rather, of the three *Śaktis*. This *sṛṣṭi ullekha nirmāṇa,* this is the description of the three *Śaktis: icchā, jñāna, kriyā*. That Swamiji has beautifully explained this. *Sṛṣṭi* means the desire to create. Um, *ullekha* means that the plan to – *ullekha* means the drawing. If you make a building, uh make a building, you know, you need a plan. And actually *nirmāṇa*, the actual building of that um uh is uh the *kriyā Śakti*. So, *icchā Śakti, jñāna Śakti, kriyā Śakti*, these three are mentioned here. 

*Kṛpā* she who is filled, *nirbhara,* with all these three *Śaktis*, and who is *jagato yeśa cidānandalakṣaṇā śaktiḥ*. Who is the ruler – feminine, I don't know how you say ruler and feminine – the Empress of the three um of the world. And she who is the ruler is *svātantryaśakti*. So, she contains uh all these three: *icchā, jñāna*, and *kriyā*. And she is denoted by the *bīja sa*.

And then *oṃ juṃ saḥ amṛteśvaraḥ*. *Sa amṛteśvaraḥ* is described *svaśakti abhivyakti mayi mūkṣe ātmasaiśvaryayogataḥ*, who is ever intent on um bestowing liberation on his worshippers for *bhaṭṭāracaṇam*. And who is full, who is manifesting his own energy, *svaśakti abhivyakti*, asya *aiśvaryayogata mayi*, he has that power to um to bestow liberation on his worshippers. And liberation means *amṛteśvaratvam*, means immortality, the state of immortality. 

*Oṃ juṃ saḥ amṛteśvaraṇāya bhairavāya*. Now, we know from the *Vijñāna Bhairava* that there are so many uh. Am I? *Vijñāna Bhairava* gives one interpretation of *bhairava*, but there are in the *tantras* you find so many um so-called etymologies of *bhairava*, which are actually um interpretations of his name and of his essence and of his being. And uh there is a whole, this book by KAS on uh Trika tradition. He has 60 pages, and it's a purely linguistic book, 60 pages only on the etymology of *bhairava* from the different *tantras* and uh Abhinavagupta and so on. So, it is a very uh a word which has a great weight in uh this tradition.

*Nīlaharṣādhi vibhenna yadbāhyābhyantaraṃ jagat ahaṃ iti ābhāsam pūrṇo bhairavaḥ samudāhṛtaḥ*, who is called *bhairavaḥ*, who is filled with the *ahaṃ iti ābhāsam*, with the reflection of *ahaṃ*. So, the true nature of *bhairava* is *ahaṃ*. It's the true I-consciousness. The ultimate I-consciousness is *ahaṃ*. But it's not an I-consciousness in contraposition, in contrast to the object, objective. In our normal awareness, we have “I” and “this,” *ahaṃ idam*, but not in his case. He is pure fullness of *ahaṃ*, which is, contains the whole universe, both external and internal, *yadbāhyābhyantaraṃ jagat*, of which is distinguished as external objects – means uh the example of this is given as blue for external objects and for internal sensations *harṣa*, that happiness. So, *nīla harṣa* always stands for external objects and internal sensations. 

So, he is the fullness of all this external and internal uh realities constituting the world. And in the full reflectivity of I-consciousness, *ahaṃ iti ābhāsam pūrṇo bhairavaḥ*,  that fullness. 

And then uh *namaḥ*. And we do so much in every tradition. You know, we we do our *praṇāma*, our *namaskāra*, and our uh *namaḥ*. *Oṁ namaḥ śivāya*, *oṁ* to all different deities of enlightened beings or the guru *namaḥ*. What does it really mean? *Dehā prāṇa sukhādinām nyagbhāvaprati samati yac cit ātmani viśrāntiḥ namaḥ śabdenā sūcyate*. It's very beautiful. The word *namaḥ*, *oṁ* is praise, means to to rest in the in pure consciousness, *cit ātmani viśrānti*, to find repose in pure consciousness.

And what – *dehā prāṇa sukhādinām nyagbhāvaprati samati*? First, you have to um reduce your ego or your pride and your identification with the body, with the *prāṇa*, with the, your emotional states and so on, *nyagbhāva*, making them um bowing, bowing, bow to bow down. See what what has to bow down? It is not that true *ahaṃ*, which is already *bhairava*. But what has to bow down, what has to be, or what has to be humiliated, is our sense of identification with the body, with the *prāṇa*, with our emotions, with our different states. And and that has to be, that has to bow down. And all this has to find rest, *viśrānti*, in the pure consciousness, *cit ātmani viśrānti*. And that is *namaḥ*. It's beautiful.

Whenever you express *oṃ namaḥ śivāya* or anything, or *namaḥ* to any uh deity, it is that um inner, first reducing your your limitations and then letting them all rest in pure consciousness. That is *namaḥ*. 

So, the last verse I'm not explaining because Swami Ji has done it very extensively, and he goes into all this *akṣaras* and the *mātrikās* and so on. This uh he has done it really. 

And then at the end, there is um at the end of the *śloka*, and what we are reciting is a praise of the Devi, in that was perhaps not understandable for those who don't know Trika. Now, in Trika the uh the one universal iconography is the *triśūla*, means the uh *triśūla*, which symbolizes the three *śaktis*. And uh and then on top of the *triśūla* the there is um um *kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*, the supreme uh Kāli. And uh that is, it is represented in. It is called *triśūlaṭṭamandala*, the mandala of the lotus and the trident. So, the *triśūla* or this symbolizes. There is the one um, what do you call that, shaft, shaft, the shaft, uh which is of course the unity, and then the three are the three *śaktis*. Um the shaft also symbolizes, of course, as we have seen yesterday, the *suṣumṇā*, or the *madhyanāḍī*.

Um the illustration is here. It's in my book, but I didn't bring my German books and it would be easier to find. I don't know if you can see, *triśūlaṭṭamandala*. This isn't the usual *triśūla*. It is simplified. It isn't the usual *triśūla* that we see in the temples uh pointing upwards. See everything is symbolic. See if uh the *triśūla* in Kashmir Shaivism, because the system is called Trika, so there are three realities. So, *triśūla* always symbolizes either the Śiva *śaktis*, or the three energies: *icchā, jñāna, kriyā*, or the three energies: *parā, parāpara*, and *aparā*. So, everything is threefold here. And uh *triśūla* is always symbolic of – it's not a weapon of Śiva or anything like that, it's a symbol, symbol for the entire system. 

It's on page 237. 

So, this is what uh the Devi who is described in this uh verse is um the *triśūla* um the three *śaktis* in the three prongs of the uh trident. And supreme, in the center of course. And then the um *kālasaṃkarṣiṇī* uh above, which is not in that drawing because it's not in this text, who is above this uh three.

So, what we have heard from um Alexander on the first day about this 12 Kālis and so on, that is contained in these two verses, which Swami Ji explained, and in which he also gives the *mantra* of *parā*, *mantra* of *parā*, and the three components of the *mantra*, which are again related to the *triśūla* and so on. So, that's these two verses.

So this was, I think, to complement what we have heard yesterday, instead of just letting it pass without understanding, to help some bitter.

So, now we come back to our text as much as we are able to do. Now, Kṣemarāja has divided uh the *Spanda Kārikā* into three, respectively, four sections. But the fourth section consists only of two verses, and these two verses we have already read in the beginning. And um so different commentators have divided into different sections because uh Vasugupta has not made any such division. And the first um he gives very beautiful names. The first section which we have completed is called *svarūpaspandā,* the uh vibration of one's own true nature, *svarūpaspandā*. And he calls the sections, not chapter, or anything, but *niṣyandā*. *Niṣyandā* means flowing out. It's a flow, because *spanda* is always something dynamic. 

Or, if you want to have the book, you can have it. Yeah, this is where it starts.

So, we have completed the first flow um which is called *svarūpaspandā*. And the second *niṣyandā,* flowing out, he has called *sahaja vijñānodayāspandā*, the vibration of the rise of the natural or spontaneous wisdom. A beautiful uh title, *sahaja vijñānodayāspandā*, the vibration of the arising of the spontaneous knowledge or wisdom. And uh it indicates of course the whole approach uh to. 

Now, before we proceed um I think it's still useful to um revise or where I think we have ended uh the last part until. Just to summarize the last three verses. Now, a little uh uh addition from what not somebody says about this. The example examples given in verse 22, about anger and extreme happiness, ex- intensive states, etcetera. Uh so much he says it's not only when this actually happen, because then you have a sudden experience of that, but even when you remember them. So, remembering such intense states also brings you back to that splendor. And what happens at that time? Then his breath stops altogether. And it returns in *suṣumṇā,* and this is uh at that uh point, at that moment it enters in the central vein at once. When he just thinks of that intensity of joy, anger, etcetera, his breath stops, and his breath enters in the central vein. 

So, this is to uh complement. Now here because the question was um the uh because somebody says in the heart, from the heart. No no, it's not from the general, the text. But um it is equally um it can happen in *mūladhara,* somebody says, and we should, we know of course. It can happen either at the level of *mūladhara* or at the level of the heart. So, these are all different experiences, so there's no absolutely uniformity. I mean the *Tantras* give us a like a landscape, or like a uh map um map of the spiritual uh experience. And then in that map, you will find where you, your experience is situated. And uh so that uh may be um situated at *mūladhara* or at *hṛdaya*. But certain things are definitely universal, uh generally um uh accepted in all uh by all uh schools uh. And then there uh variations according to *Tantras*, according to masters, according to um traditions, etcetera. 

When you're saying it happens in *mūladhara* or heart, are you saying that the breath stops there? 

The breath stops uh when it enters into the central vein, that's right. Stops doesn't mean that you die.

No, that's right. Because from that. 

But uh you're saying it happens in *mūladhara* or heart. Means what is, what is happening there? It happens, you said uh it happens in *mūladhara* or in heart?

Yeah yeah.

So, what is that happening? What is happening? We have done this in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*, there are very intensely um that uh if you want to go back to the *Vijñāna Bhairava* we can do it. Um in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*, it is uh it it that is a uh whole development from verse 26 to 26 27 28 29. And out of these 28 29 are concerned with *kuṇḍalinī* rising. And 26 and 27 with the centering of the breath. So, 26, “The energy of breath neither moves out nor enters,” I've already modified my translation. “When the center unfolds by the dissolution of thoughts, then one attains the nature of Bhairava.” The center unfolds by *nirvikalpa*, and that we have discussed it uh before you came. Um, is it that the *vikalpas* cease because you enter into that center, or do you enter because the *vikalpas* cease? So, it is a very very um you can only distinguish in your own experience what what is first and what is second. Um but they are definitely intimately uh related. So, the the cessation of thoughts, the entering into the center, the overcoming of the duality of *prāṇa apāna,* these are all uh very closely uh connected. And it, it is uh that is described in 26. 

Well, 27 actually goes back a little bit to uh more um *mahāyogic prāṇāyāma*, which um. But then this, the the progress of this is in 28, and that is then the rising of the *śakti* from *mūladhara*. And what we said yesterday, to getting subtler and subtler. *Sūkṣmāt sūkṣmatarātmikām āmulād kirṇapāsāṁ sūkṣmāt sūkṣmatarātmikām.* See, from the *mūla* and the like rays or like rays of light becoming more and more subtle until they dissolve in the uh *dvādaśānta*, which is either here or beyond, and that is not said, but it it depends on the level of the yogi. So, you can go back to *Vijñāna Bhairava*. 

And the beauty uh of the description of at the end of the first uh *niśānda* is that getting dissolved in the great ether of consciousness, *mahāvyoma*. This is uh such a wonderful expression: *mahāvyoma*. *Mahāvyomaṁ pralīnaṁ śaśibhāskare*, where the sun and the moon uh dissolve. Sun and the moon are *prāṇa apāna.* And of course, there are many other interpretations: the subject and the object and uh and so on. But the direct uh meaning is the two breaths.

Is it, is it similar to *cidākāśa*? Is it this *cidākāśa*?

It is *cidākāśa*. It is the same. I mean only the the word is different. 

And we had, before this expression, which is maybe not in the text, but in Kṣemarāja: *mahāvikāsavyāpti*. Now, this *vyāpti* is um a very important stage in the yoga of the school. Means when you reach that stage of transcending the duality, that is pervasiveness, that state of pervasiveness. And then there is still beyond *mahāvyāpti*. Or is *Śivavyāpti* also? But I don't know whether they are in in *Śivavyāpti*,  *mahāvyāpti*, are they the same? I think so. *Ātmavyāpti*? *Ātmavyāpti*, but that is uh below. Below. Below *mahāvyāpti*. The *Śivānanda* has a very beautiful thing about this *vyāpti,* stages of *vyāpti:* pervasiveness. And when you think of the five *prāṇas,* of course, *vyāpti*, that corresponds to *vyāna*. So, who can tell the five *prāṇas*? 

*Apāna, prāṇa, udāna, samāna*, and *vyāna.* Yeah. 

So, *vyāna* is the the pervasive, the the uh pervading uh power of energy of breath. And that corresponds to *vyāpti* and pervasiveness. 

Okay, now we come to the second um um. I am not reading the introduction of Kṣemarāja, but I'm just summarizing. But he says is, is according to him also, see, the division is made by Kṣemarāja, not by Vasugupta. The first section was devoted to *nimīlanasamādhi*. To introverted practice of uh *samādhi*. And the second uh section, to *unmīlanasamādhi*, means to the integration of the universe. *Vaiśvātmyaṁ* uh *unmīlanasamādhi prativijñeyam yuktitaḥ*. But he, so all the words he uses are very very appropriate. This *yukti*, we have, we had uh *upayoga*, *yukti*, and uh *vaiśvātmyaṁ* means the universal um state of *unmīlanasamādhi*. And both are related to *prativijñā*, means recognition of the uh the *prativijñā* in the first section of the *nimīlana*, of the introverted state, and then recognition of the extroverted or universal – not extroverted, extroverted is wrong – universal state, *vaiśvātmyaṁ*. 

And then he gives a kind of very systematic, he gives a kind of survey, like you give in your when you write a book, you give a survey of the chapters which you're going to um the content – table of contents, so to say – but um to compare the two sections. And then he, because this uh second part is related to universal aspect, he has to speak of the entire cosmic um expanse of the 36 *tattvas*. And there he says, which uh those who know the Shaiva uh cosmology, they know that there this um two levels of the 36 *tattvas*: the pure way, *śuddhādhva,* pure, yes, *śuddhādhvan*, and the impure way, *aśuddhādhvan*. And the the impure, *aśuddhādhvan,* it, it goes from uh *pṛthivī*, from earth up to *māyā*. So, *māyā* is the limit. And the pure way starts from *śuddhavidyā,* from the pure wisdom, pure knowledge, *śuddhavidyā,* up to Śiva. So, this whole hierarchy is um what constitutes the entire uh universe.

So, when you say earth to *māyā*, earth to *māyā*, earth is lower than *māyā*?

This hierarchy always means that, is um uh it goes from – everything they say from earth to Shiva, so that the entire gamut of 36 *tattvas* is contained between from earth to Shiva. So, the, well, you have just to see that the least you know, then because it's a very complex system. And there are groups of five and son, which we know from *Sāṅkhya*, five elements, five *tanmātras*, five *indriyas*, and so on, and so on. So, why do we say *prapañca*? *Prapañca*, because there are groups of five. So, they, the uh this external world, they consist all – why do we have five fingers, five toes? Everything is fivefold. Um and five elements, five *tanmātras*, five senses, five organs of action, five organs of uh knowledge, etcetera. Uh so this earth is – earth means earth is not, not the uh physical element earth, means the the the principle of earth. And that is um the principle of earth is, means the element of solidity.

Then, if you take water, the element of liquidity. Water doesn't mean just only water. It means everything that is liquid, you know. Like in *Āyurveda*, the uh great part of the body is water. So um this is all the the water element. It's it's not the the physical element, but the principle. The the quality.

And solidity is uh *jaḍatva*.

Hmm, *jaḍatvā jaḍatā*. Um, the earth. 

It's not *jaḍa*. They they no, *jaḍa* mean – even water may be *jaḍa*, but uh but um um uh in in the the, philosophically, whether. Now he, he goes into that. The the quality of the *tattvas* and how they are mutually dependent. It's all mutually dependent. See, there is no earth without water, etcetera, etcetera. So, it's all integrated, but still in order to understand the the structure of the universe, you have to distinguish in a kind of hierarchical.

And, and why didn't you um say up till the *Śivatattva*, and not *īśvaratattva* and *sadāśivatattva*? 

Hmm. 

And why didn't you finish with *sadāśivatattva* and not with uh, you finish with *shivatattva*?

So, pure means from *māyā* to Śiva. Not on higher, from *śuddhavidyā* to to Śiva, and not *īśvaratattva* and *sadāśivatattva* we included.

No, they they are not this, there. They are all in the pure. They are also included in Śiva, but they they they are in the pure. I mean uh up to Śiva.

Ha, up to Śiva.

Up to Śiva, but Śiva not the transcendent uh the divinity Śiva, as a *tattva*. So that, we have to be very clear. And I don't want to give a whole lecture on the *tattvas*, because it's a very big subject. And uh those who are not familiar, I would recommend some of these, some of these others, very brief but very concise, and this “Kashmir Shaivism: Secrets of Supremely” asks a chapter on the *tattvas* uh where he gives the list also.

Uh see, when you say that uh 36 *tattva* is Śiva, that does not mean uh *para* uh *anutrā* or anything. It means as far as you can categorize. You categorize. These are categories when you can objectify. If you worship Śiva in a *mūrti*, in a *liṅga*, or something uh that is *shivatattva*. It's not Śiva. So, this distinction is uh is uh very important, because when they speak sometimes of the 37th *tattva*, but it's not a *tattva*. It's not a *tattva*. It's just beyond the 36. 

Okay, but this is only because of the cosmic um uh description of the cosmos that we have to speak on that, but otherwise, we are not concerned with the *tattvas* here. 

Is that clear? 

Hmm. 

What is the etymological root of *tattva*?

It's very easy. *Tat*, *tva*. *Tat* means “this,” and *tva* means this. *Tva* is an abstract suffix, “thisness.” So, anything which uh uh is uh this, that that, that is a. So, it's both a reality and the principle and the category of um. 

So, what you can point at that that. In in the *Upaniṣads*, if you remember, there are many passages there, all *tat sat*. It said, “There is nothing but that, only that,” to which you point. 

The *tad akramya balam mantra*. 

So, in in Jadunath Singh's book, page 110, the *tad akramya balam mantra*: *sarvajña balaśālinā pravartante adhikārāyaḥ karaṇā karaṇāni iva dehinām*. So, these two verses go together. *Tattvaiva samparayantī śāntarūpā nirañjanā sahārdhatva ciktenā tīnaiti śivadhāminā.*

So, we are not talking here of *tattvas*. We are talking of *mantras*. But then see the. So, in in um Mark's translation, because he follows the other commentaries, the counting of the verses goes through. It is not a section 1, 2, and so on. So here, in his translation uh verses 27, uh 26, 27: “Seizing that strength, *mantras* endowed with the power of omniscience perform their functions as do the senses of the embodied. It is they alone that, they quiescent and stainless, dissolve the way, along with the adept's mind, and so partake of Śiva's nature.” 

Now, if you, I, I was so struck you know, when I read this passage of the that anonymous guru yesterday. It's exactly the same. The dissolve the way into the quiescent uh. In Jadunath Singh's: “Resorting to that power, the divinities, *mantra,* etcetera, together with the sacred formula, which serve as the indicators.” 

Now I am explaining what difference he is making here. “Being endowed with the power of omniscience proceed to carry out their assigned functions towards the embodied ones just as the senses of the embodied ones by resorting to the power of *śāntātītā* proceed to carry out their specific functions.”

Now, the difference uh in the translation of Jadunath Singh is that he takes,according, following Kṣemarāja, he takes *mantra* in two meanings. Now, *mantra,* we have the uh sacred, powerful word, and *mantra* as um subjects, as divinities. And this is a very complex uh subject. Now, *mantras* are not only uh words, or we don't need to translate *mantra* in that sense at all because it is well known. But *mantras* are also perceivers. So, there are levels of uh. And this is a little complicated, and then in there is a very nice uh clear chapter by Swami Jaidev in this book, “Kashmir Shaivism: Seven Levels of *Pramātās*.” *Pramātā* means uh perceiver, or subject. And uh these that, from *mantra*, *mantreśvara*, *mantra maheśvara*, and and so on. 

Yeah, it is uh uh “Seven States of the Seven Perceivers,” uh in Swamiji's book. So, no no, he, he doesn't start here from the lower level. He starts from the level of *mantra*. That is the lower level, of course, um. Uh I I'm not talking about the lower levels, *sakala*, *pṛthvīkāla*, *vigyāna kāla*. Uh and um if this thing sounds very complex and complicated, the point of this list of the seven *pramātās* is that there are levels of consciousness. And uh uh they are not mythological beings uh these uh *pramātās, mantreśvaras*, but they are, if, when the yogi advances from the state of individuality, *sakala,* to the state of Śiva, he goes through these different stages. And these are the seven uh stages. And *mantra* is where actually the the spiritual experience starts. *Sakala* uh *pṛthvīkāla* and *vigyāna kāla*, that these are still the lowest stages. 

But the other commentators, they take *mantra* here only in the sense of “formula,” only in the sense of uh the sacred word. So that is why Kṣemarāja's commentary is a bit more complex because he takes these two levels of *mantra*. 

And both meanings of *mantra*: they are endowed with omniscience, *sarvajña*. *Sarvajña balaśālinā,* they are, they are endowed with the power of omniscience. That's why *mantras* are powerful, because they are omniscient. They are *sarvajña balaśālinā*. And when he says that *tad akramya balam mantrahāḥ*, *tat* means, of course, *spanda*. So, *mantras* are um deriving their strength from that *spanda*, from that what we had in the last few uh characters. And they perform certain functions. Now, we know *mantras* perform functions. And we have *mantras* which perform very low functions. And you can have black magic with *mantras*, or white magic, or you can have the supreme highest uh transcendent um meaning of *mantras*, which uh lead you directly to to *mokṣa*. 

What's black magic and white magic?

Black, black magic if you want to kill somebody, or you want to destroy something, or white magic if you want to help somebody, or you want to heal somebody. So, these are all performed by *mantras*. We know all these so-called *tāntriks* in India, they they are using uh *mantras* for all this special purposes.

Hmm. 

And the work. A *mantra* to kill somebody?

Ha?

They work. They work of course. If they wouldn't work, then uh they would have given up long ago. No more customers. 

Ha!

No more customers.

No more customers, will they? So many customers. No, if they give it to work. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Yes, customers are fine please.

And they increase, yeah yeah yeah.

A miracle. 

Milarepa is a classic example.

Ha?

Milarepa. Milarepa, the Tibetan yogi. 

Yeah, who wanted to take a revenge on his uncle who appropriate all his father's property. So, he practiced black magic, and he killed uh I think either 18 or 21.

35. 

35, isn't it?

And then he realized they got wrong. Then he went to the cave, and then he started uh.

Yeah, of course, of course. He did all sort of nonsense to get the real. So, he uh.

So, it works in both ways for him? It's uh he destroyed the whole village, you know.

But does this work up to the level of death like like up to the level of, you know, getting harmed, or getting, you know, sick, or up to the level of death?

Of course. So, I mean, I live in Banares. Banares is full of this thing. 

It's power. I don't think also in Banares. It's a Bengal. Bengal.

Yeah yeah, she knows better about Bengal. 

I mean, many parts – *mantras* to protect yourself also. There must be *mantras* to protect yourself. 

What's that?

To protect yourself.

Of course, there are *mantras*. These are all *mantras*. These are you know, the counter-*mantra*. 

So, those who are specialists in *mantras*, whether black or white, or magicians, or yogis, or great yogis, um they know that the power of *mantra* derives from that force. They may not give it the name *spanda*, but they know that there is a force that accomplishes what a *mantra* wants. It relying on that force, and that is the force not only of some uh physical, but it is the force of omniscience in the highest sense, *sarvajña bala śālinaṃ.* 

And they perform their functions, though often they are *kārya.* And these functions, they are compared to the functions of the senses in the embodied being, as we have seen before. The *traiva sampralayante,* and this is so beautiful. Now, we come really, often, the high, high, high level of *mantra*, and not its low levels. What we have, this is freed of all limitations of office after having performed their assigned duties. They're, they're denotation as particular deities having ceased. Because *mantras*, even the *mantras* which you pronounce, they are a kind of deities. They get dissolved together with the mind of their devotees in that very *spanda* principle – well, *spanda* principle is not said here uh but um understood. Hence, they are of the nature of Śiva. *Kinnete śivaterminaḥ*. 

The *traiva sampralayante*. Uh this *traiva* means there itself. It means from where they have risen, from where they have drawn their strength, there they get again dissolved, but they they again merge and get dissolved there. And they are of peaceful nature and spotless, *nirañjanaḥ śāntarūpā nirañjanaḥ*. So, these are not magical *mantras* which I meant here. *Saha ārādhakacittena*. So, they, they attain the peaceful state together with the mind of the practitioner. And therefore, they are of the nature of Śiva. 

And this, precisely what we have read yesterday, that the *mantra* um gets dissolved in that peaceful state, along with the mind, no?

The rhythm celestial is. 

Yeah yeah.

So, if Kṣemarāja says that the second section, according to him, concerns the universal uh aspect, then *mantra* is a very essential component of uh that universal um practice of *spanda*. What exactly –

So, there is a long – yeah, yes.

Sorry?

What exactly is meant by the universal aspect of that?

Well now, *mantra,* we are only entering into that, you know. That will come. Universal, the universal aspect in the sense that before the, the tendency was towards introversion. And although he has said that the *suprabuddhaḥ*, he has to have both, both introverted and uh the universal state. But now he goes more into the universal aspect of uh the integration of the all the external um aspects into the internal uh, but he will come to that.

Now, uh of course Kṣemarāja gives a detailed interpretation. And we don't need to go uh necessarily in all this. Because their only uh difficulty is about the seven *pramātās*. But you see it. Why? How can you say that *mantras* are omniscient, *sarvajña*, and to say, “The *mantras,*” – words used as *mantras* – “do not transgress the state of the experiencer even at the mixed stage and have no limitation in knowledge like the *buddhi.*” *Buddhi*, etcetera. “Therefore, their omniscience is perfectly justifiable.” 

And he quotes *Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā*: “The ascertainment expressed in the form, ‘This is a jar,’ is the power of the highest lord, beyond name and form. It always shines as one with the eye, and never as this.” 

So, this is a very general statement about language, but especially in the a case of *mantra*, this applies. “This matter has been explained at length in the *Īśvara Pratyabhijñā*. The power of *māyā* shows itself in manifesting, and then looting,” etcetera. 

Then just at the end, it uh: “Thus it is meant to be said that the *spanda* principle is the substratum of the *mantras.*” Not word which achieves its glory. 

And you know what is more important is that from the *Tripurāsāra* itself, “This *mantra* is said to be the inherent nature,” *svābhāva,* “of the power of consciousness, for by concentrating on it constantly, the yogi abides well established in Śiva's plane of being.” It is by virtue of this that those yogis who apply their minds to yoga know the true nature of ultimate reality. 

Get that? Yeah, because now, many of the *Śiva Sūtras*, they are quoting this.

No no, but this is a *Pantakarīka*, and *Śiva Sūtra* is so close. 

I think let us stop here. 

And some of the books are here if you want to refer to *Śiva Sūtra* or something. The important thing is, now we have the basis for understanding of *mantras*, and then it will unfold because the theme of *mantra* continues, and its connection with *Tantra*. 

Can a person pick up any *mantra*, like what is this?

Look, no no. That is always, the *mantras* are very clear about it, that it is not at all allowed. And it doesn't make any sense. Or it may have even negative consequences. And as you see in some *mantras*, um um most of the powerful and sacred *mantras,* they are not expressed even. They only, in a coded language. So, unless you receive it from your guru, it doesn't make sense.
