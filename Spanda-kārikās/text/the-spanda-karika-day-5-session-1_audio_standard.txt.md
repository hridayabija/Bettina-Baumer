We have a few things which we could listen to. Uh, one is, um, some who came a day later requested us to play again this *Mahāmṛtyuñjaya Mantra* of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. So, it's up to you when you want to listen to it. 

One ideal time for me always to listen to, uh, stories is noontime, means from 11:00 to 12:00, and then listen meditatively, and then when it finishes, just enter into meditation. So, you can choose, um, because most of us have already heard it, but it is worth listening again. 

Then we have as, um, um, Indra reminded me, I have the CD of Kashmiri style of recitation of *Bhairavastotra* and *Gurustuti*. That also we can listen, um, maybe today at noontime, one of them. *Bhairavastotra*, we recited ourselves, but, uh, we can listen to it in that Kashmiri, uh, to some other time for us to appreciate mainly. 

And the third one is, um, today, maybe the last one of the book of *Siddi* and, uh, and the, um, and that is, uh, most precious because my copy has disappeared. With these seminars, sometimes ways of distributing not only knowledge but also, uh, CDs. 

Um, one of the most important mantras of, um, our tradition is *Mṛtyusaṃbhāra Mantra*. And, um, there is an explanation of every word of the mantra by Swamiji. Um, he said it is from the *Netra Tantra*, but I have not found it in the *Netra Tantra*. But as we have heard, in all many tantras, have maybe parts which are not in the published editions, so, uh, we don't know. But definitely, this, um, interpretation of the mantra is very beautiful, starting what means *Oṁ*, what means *tru*, what means *saḥ*. So, every syllable, every detail will be explained. And that is Swamiji's explanation of this mantra. So that also we could listen. Um, maybe also at noontime. 

I think that is better because, evening, one wants to be in silence. Uh, I, what is the general feeling in the evening? Also, we can listen. Evening we will already too. Huh? Evening, evening? Evening? This is basically, you know, we celebrate the *Aṣṭamī* before the *Saptamī*. Tomorrow is the Lord Krishna, but you celebrate today. Uh, tradition is that we celebrate before the, uh, you reserve for the another day? 

Uh, no. Actually, I remember a discussion of Swamiji with the *Jyotiṣīs* that they can never agree on one day. You know, they always have to be fight whether *Udaya Tithi* or this *Aṣṭamī Tithi*, or what is that. 

Uh, no, but as you, you are right. That was one of my points with *Aṣṭamī*, um, actually the, the evening before it, it is part of the celebration. 

So then, which one should we listen to in the evening? This mantra, *Oṁ Triśul*? We have not listened to it before. No, no, no. No. Swamiji's explanation. Huh? Swamiji's, Swamiji's voice this? Yeah, um, explaining the mantra. So, we could have those of us who know have to recite the mantra because he doesn't recite the mantra, explains only. And, uh, okay, then this will be our entry into *Janmāṣṭamī*. Well, did you, can you give us the mantra now with, that we can, can you write it for us, the mantra, so then, the mantra? Yes, this mantra, then after we can go for lunch. Yeah. In, in the *pāṇḍigeria*, I will translate. And let me read the, the translation before. Okay. 

When is a visit to the Vaiṣṇava Temple? You ask, you ask Indra, that Indra. 

So, if tomorrow the weather is fine, of course, uh, um, *Janmāṣṭamī*, there may be some crowd. Um, but, um, we would like to go for the *Ārtī* in the evening. 

Yeah, but they do Vaiṣṇava better than we have to arrange cars. You know, we cannot walk. And, uh, if we make an excursion to Vaiṣṇava, we should combine it also with, um, um, *Śāradā Pīṭha* Monastery because that can be one circuit. And for that, I would request you to find out what time would be their *Pūjā*, that we are allowed inside the temple. Oh, because last year, we were not allowed because there was a retreat going on, *Śāradā Pīṭha* still going on, but then, it is not *Pūjā*, if we are not allowed inside. 

It's about to finish though because yesterday, we were going and there was still retreat, but they are finishing. I can ask, "When they finish?" 

You please find out if it's still going on today. Okay, I'll ask. So, maybe we, maybe this evening, under the tree, we could find out if, um, the retreat is going on, or since then, I mean, it's 55 days, just to phone them. I don't know if the retreat is because if it is tomorrow, then we have to arrange it this afternoon. Okay. Okay. Yes. 

Can you, uh, give us your translation again? Can you translate this, uh, Sanskrit into another form? This, this mantra, translate? Yeah, I don't want to recite it now. I want to, um, we will recite it, but, um, not just now. 

There's, sorry. You, do, can you read? Yeah. *Anubhavaḥ*. 

So, I am not going into the whole history because it's, um, in the, all four, it's everything is connected. So, there's no harm in repeating something. 

In the *Mālinīvijayottara Tantra*, we find only three *ślokas* relating to three *upāyas*. That is *ānanda*, *śakti*, and *śāmbhava*. And it doesn't call them *upāya*, he calls them *samāveśaḥ*, three ways of entering into the divine, of probation, divine probation, whatever you may translate *samāveśaḥ*. And, uh, this is, it's always interesting to see how the tradition, not only repeats the same thing, expands on the same thing, but invents also, uh, in, uh, improves and enlarges. 

So, Abhinavagupta was one of those who, uh, due, uh, due to his name, which he also interpreted often like that, who was both hidden and ever new. So, that newness also expressed itself by getting, having new ideas. 

So, he inverted the whole scheme, and he started from the highest, not from *śāmbhava*, but from the *anupāya*. *Anupāya* means the no means. There is nothing to be done, there is nowhere to go. That is because the reality of Śiva is ever-present and, uh, so, what will, um, as it says, this poor *pramaṇaḥ*, what will this poor *upayāḥ* do in relation to the divine, who is all-pervasive and who is, uh, uh, ever accessible to everybody. So, that is, of course, understandable, uh, one of the shortest chapters because, uh, this, uh, there's no, no technique to be taught, etc. 

So, he descends from the highest level. Uh, then from the, the second from above is *śāmbhavopāya* is the divine way. Divine means, and divine means, uh, is related in the scheme of the energies to *icchā*, *icchāśakti*. It is purely, um, uniting your will with the divine will. There is also not much to be done, except to be aware. Awareness is the main, um, and awareness of what? Um, of course, that is also not so simple because he goes into the whole question, that the whole universe is a reflection of the divine. This whole doctrine of *bimba pratibimba* comes in the divine, uh, way, but you have to be aware that this whole, uh, *bimba pratibimba*, it reflects back to the *bimba*, and, um, to that, uh, unity of, uh, the, the universe and, uh, and the divine. And it is not so easy because the whole speculation on language and on mantra also belongs to the *śāmbhavopāya*, which does not mean using mantra as a device, but mantra as, that the whole language as being a divine, um, uh, expression or the symbol of the divine. So, *śāmbhavopāya* is the highest means as far as means are concerned. 

And then, uh, one degree lower is *śaktopāya*, that the way of energy. And this corresponds to the energy of knowledge, *jñānaśakti*. Sorry to send you out. Thank you, thank you. *Jñānaśakti*. So, um, *śaktopāya* is related to, to knowledge and, and, of course, to whatever has to do with, uh, energy, with, uh,  *śakti*. 

And then, the lowest is *anu upayā*. Yesterday, we explained *anu* as the atom, the smallest fragment which we are in our individuality and *anu upayā* is the means which corresponds to that fragmented consciousness which is our individuality. That is why most of the means, most of the ways, uh, it may be religious activity, yoga, and all kinds of practices belong to this way because they, the purpose is to transform the individual consciousness into the divine consciousness and starting from where the individual stands. And that is corresponding to *kriyā śakti*, and that is why anything which is connected with activity falls under this, uh, uh, *upayā*. So, activity may be ritual activity or yogic activity, and so on. And it's all connected with *anu upayā*. 

Now, why does Abhinavagupta turn it around? Of course, he has his theological reasons, um, which are easy to understand. But in practice, um, what does it mean? It means that the perfect master, he judges the state of mind of consciousness of the disciple. And he always starts from the higher. So, he plays if the disciple, uh, responds, if he is ready, you know, then that it is done, you know. You don't have to go down to *anu upayā* and again start at *āsanā* and this and this. But, um, if he's not ready, then he goes one step below, then he goes one step below. And it's not the kind of, uh, it is rather expecting of the highest of the disciple. And this is something, something very, very beautiful, you know, the dignity of even the beginner. First, you are expected to respond to the highest stage. And if you are not able to, then it's your own, um, loss. Um, but, um, so, this pedagogy is, is really very fascinating in Abhinavagupta. 

Now, Jayaratha, being his disciple, of course, he applies this scheme to all his commentaries, uh, also to the *Śiva Sūtra*, and, and so on. *Upayam*, um, mentioning in *upayas tīra* that stay on the way of energy, *śaktopayā*. The general principle which we know from the *Vijñāna Bhairava* is that we have to overcome our *vikalpas*, our thought constructs, our imaginations, our projections, etcetera. And how to do this? On the lowest level, we do it by doing activity, and the lowest is that. But at the level of *śaktopayā*, there is a recognition that where you cannot overcome the *vikalpas* all at once, they will be there all the time there. But you can concentrate them on, into one pure thought. And that is called *śuddhavikalpa*. And, um, so that there are many thoughts, many *vikalpas*, to bring them into one pure thought, *śuddhavikalpa*. That is the main practice of, of *śaktopayā*. 

And the *śuddhavikalpa*, that is what, uh, you can find in this text, you know, sometimes one phrase which strikes you as this is just hitting the point. And then you stay with that phrase, and that is a way of meditation. You take that phrase into meditation, and it may be after some time you may leave it behind. But just to start with this that, this one. Yes. 

Where are they, uh, the four highest? Yes. In the *Tantrāloka* of Abhinavagupta and in the short version *Tantrāsāra*. The *Tantrāloka* in extenso and in the *Tantrāsāra* in a short way. The *Tantrāloka* is translated into Italian and the chapters on the *upayās* also in French but not yet published in English. So it's Sanskrit and… 

So, take, for example, uh, a sentence like that quotation which, I mean, you could, uh, notice that I am very much touched by that sentence. That quotation from the last *āgama*, last *sūtra*, that he throws, the yogi throws his *indriyas* into all directions, but you alone remain established in the center like a pillar of gold. And this "You alone" is, of course, the divine, but the divine in yourself. So, if, I mean, such a phrase, it has to strike you that there's something, you know, which just touches you. And then you stay with that phrase in your meditation, let it have its effect, and, and then let it subside, let it… So, this would be the practice of *śaktopayā* as using one *śuddhavikalpa*. 

We should, we call for the *ślokas* also? Hm? Are these *śuddhavikalpas*, *ślokas* that we're learning, would these be… It's not a question. No, no, no. No. I mean, you can take it from, from the *śloka*. It has to be something which touches you. It may be something very simple or, or apparently. But it has to touch you at a point where you, you feel that you have to work on that. You have to… Yeah. To go deeper with that sentence. If you, if you analyze something logically and understand it logically, then you're already gone. Then it's no longer, uh, *śuddhavikalpa*. It's just, uh, rational explanation. 

But, of course, many of you may be meditating with mantra. And, uh, similar, uh, thing, of course, happens with, if you start with mantra. And here quoting, um, an unknown master who was living according to Kaśmīra Śaivism, and he passed away last year. And which I find very beautiful. If you start with mantra, what happens? The mantra diffuses, only the energy remains. The syllables are resolved, while the resonance is retained to lead to attunement with the *spanda*, the vibration, the unalloyed absorption into the eternal *nāda*, the rhythm celestial. Find this a beautiful summary of, of *spanda* in relation to mantra and what happens to your mantra in meditation, how it gets resolved into its energy, into its pure vibratory, uh, state. It's not, uh, it's like something which is not going on saying, "*oṃ namaḥ śivāya, oṃ namaḥ śivāya, oṃ namaḥ śivāya*." There's, uh, sometimes very funny imitating people who are just, you know, doing the mantra with the lips and, uh, but this is a different, uh, stage. 

Can you, can you read it again? Hm? Can you just repeat it again? So, this is a secret thing which has become to me, the mantra diffuses, only the energy remains. The syllables are resolved while the resonance is retained to lead to attunement with the *spanda*, the vibration, the unalloyed absorption into the eternal *nāda*, the rhythm celestial. 

Do you have it in Sanskrit also? Hm? Do you have it in Sanskrit also? Do you have it in Sanskrit? No, no, this was his inspiration. No, but he said, um, but he said, who said that it was lost? Was it written in Sanskrit originally? No, no, no. That's what I say, this is a modern master. He, uh, passed away last year. But he had, he lived that spirituality. So that came from his own experience. 

So, where, um, the connection with, uh, *śaktopayā* and *jñāna*, knowledge? It seems like, uh, we're talking more mantra, inspiration rather than the connection with knowledge, *jñāna*. Where does that connection come in at? 

Well, I think, um, you know, there are big chapters in the *Tantrāloka*. I cannot really summarize it now in a few words. Um, see, the, the five of the three energies of Śiva are connected with these three, uh, *upayās*. And so, knowledge, we often have, um, a different concept than what, uh, is implied in, in the Sanskrit, um… So, it's not knowledge as discursive knowledge. But still, that is not excluded. And it's never excluded, but it is subservient. Understanding is, that's why all these texts are perfectly logical if you analyze them, but, um, it is, this is only one level. And the other level is precisely where, um, the word leads you. We had that other scheme, you know, from the, the, the spoke, you know. Thought, the word leads you to the supreme level of the word. But, uh, this is a very big topic, so I wouldn't like to go into it now. 

So, let's come back to our text. I, I made a mistake. I said that, uh, the word *spanda* appears only in verse 22, but it appears in verse 19. So, uh, but still, 18 verses, we have been waiting for this, uh, word to appear. So, verse 17 was a very crucial one. That's why we had to stop yesterday. And…

The three states, just once between the three states. The three states, just once between the three states. The three states… Yes, the three states here? He means, actually, only waking, dreaming, deep sleep. Um, I mean, and the, the question of beginning and end as, um, we had that yesterday also. Beginning and end as we have, this practice is in *Vijñāna Bhairava*. It's not directly meant here. Actually, it relates to the others, to the states of, um, waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. And then, this question came that how, how to find that point between dream and deep sleep, so that, uh, for advanced yogis. And, and, of course, the main thing is how to spread this consciousness in the middle also. See, we sit in meditation, suppose, morning and evening. So, what happens the whole day? Uh, that's a middle. So, is that same consciousness continuing, flowing into all activities? And that's the whole difference between the *paśu*, *paśu*, and the *supāśu*. 

Now, we come to verse 18. 

*Jñāna-jñeya-svarūpiṇyā śaktyā paramayā yutāḥ, pada-dvaye vibhāti tat anyathā tu cinmayā.* 

The all-pervading Lord, *vibhu*, possessed of the supreme power, *paramayā śaktyā yutah*, of knowledge and knowable, *jñāna-jñeya-svarūpiṇyā*, whose, uh, of the nature of knowledge. Okay. You have it already, the answer here in brief. She is, um, of the nature of both knowledge and knowable, appears in the two states of waking and dream, *pada-dvaye*, and that he has added, but to connect it as knowledge and objects of knowledge, and in the other than these two as nothing but consciousness. That *anyathā tu cinmayā*.  

Now, um, here the state of waking, um, the waking state is the state of objectivity near and the dreaming state is the state of, uh, knowledge. And, but they are both their energies, their *śaktis*. See the difference, uh, we are coming back again and again and again to the same, uh, point, but I think it drives it a little more stronger. What we had with the sense organs, no? The senses which are, um, powerless if they are not empowered by the, this power, by, by this, um, uh, *karaṇa śarīris*, by the, the *śakti*. And, uh, Swamiji has a very nice expression here. He says, uh, they have power, but it is borrowed from another department. Their power is borrowed from another department. So, we are not aware of this, uh, that we have our power is borrowed. It's, it's not our own. So here also Swamiji says the Lord's energy or primal power means objectivity is functioning in wakefulness, and the Lord Shiva's energy of cognitive, uh, power is functioning in his dreaming state. His means of the yogi of the, uh, *SubhPrabuddha*. So, his dreaming state and wakefulness are also divine. 

And then, there are two more states, and these two more states he simply says, "*anya trato chemaya*," means in deep sleep and in *turiya*, there's nothing but consciousness. Of course, at different degrees, deep sleep is, uh, different. But still, for the *SubhPrabuddha*, uh, you have that famous, uh, uh, *śloka*, you know, "*nitrAsamAdhi sthitihi*." But it's a whole, um, beautiful words, but only one section is his, his sleep is a state of *samādhi*. Many people quote it like that, but it's not so easy, you know, if your sleep is really a state of *samādhi*. So, this is what is meant there in, in *suṣupti*, in deep sleep. There's nothing but consciousness. So, this is something absolutely beautiful, you know, if you, your mind becomes transparent. Suppose this evening meditation, you know, you don't get disturbed after evening meditation. You enter into that state, and that state itself continues like *samādhi*. And it is so absolutely beautiful. There's no effort, there's nothing, you know, just being that transparent, uh, uh, this is the "*anya trato chemaya*." And that means *turiya* means it is this *chema ya*. *Turiya* is, uh, uh, it's always *chema ya* even for the, for the unenlightened, uh, if he enters into *turiya*, and it is *chema ya*, but *suṣupti*, uh, deep sleep, um, to be full of awareness, full of transparent consciousness, that is the state where you are not wasting time. You know, how many hours of sleep do we, uh, waste in our life? If, if they are not transformed into that state, and then it's all one flow, *niṣpanda*, you know, one flow. There are no breaks. 

So, this is just a description of the four states in the case of the *SubhPrabuddha*. And the, the difference with the *SubhPrabuddha* is precisely joined, joined with the supreme energy, *śakti paramAya yutah*. So, that's the only difference if, if he is united, if he is joined with that supreme, uh, energy. Everybody sleeps and dreams and wakes and all, all this is going on, uh, but if it is united with the supreme energy, and here *parama*, uh, *śakti* here, it's an adjective, it's not like I said before, *parā*, but joined with the supreme energy because then all these states, uh, transformed. 

So here, I, I don't need to go into, um, the commentary because it is quite clear. Now, we come to the important verse 19, finally, *spanda* appears. 

*guṇādi spandanishyandaḥ sāmanyaspandasanshayāt labdhātmalābhāḥ satataṃ suyaṃ asyā aparipanthinaḥ.* 

It's very nicely expressed. Uh, *yasyā* means the, uh, of the knower, and the knower here means the *SubhPrabuddha*, *guṇādi spandanishyandaḥ*, the, the flow. Flow, *niṣyanda* means flowing out. So, emanation, he translates it in the sense of… I'm sorry, I didn't look at Mark's translation. Uh, so, 18, I'm just reading Mark's translation, uh, uh, it's beautiful, but it doesn't change the meaning. The only present Lord appears in two states, in union with his supreme power whose form is knowledge and its objects. Elsewhere, apart from these two states, he manifests his pure consciousness. So, that's very beautiful. 

Remind me the streams of the pulsation of the qualities along with the other principles are grounded in the universal vibration of consciousness and so attain being, so attain being. Therefore, they can never obstruct the enlightenment. So, this is very important. So, in Jaidev Singh's translation, the particular emanations of *spanda* which begin with the *guṇas* and which acquire the existence by having recourse to generic *spanda* can never stand in the way of the one who has realized his essential nature. This is, uh, the condition is *labdhātmalābhāḥ satataṃ* and so on, so who has realized his essential nature. 

So here, he speaks of two kinds of *spanda*, two kinds of… That's better we don't translate *spanda*. Actually, the most beautiful translation I find is by Swamiji, but it cannot be always applied. He says, "*spanda* is movement in stillness and stillness in movement" because you cannot say it's only movement, you cannot say it's only stillness, but movement and stillness and stillness in movement. I like this. 

So, he speaks here immediately of two kinds of *spanda*: *guṇādi spandanisyanda* and *sāmanyaspanda samshayam*. 

So, that *spanda* which flows out in the *guṇas*. Now, *guṇas* are those which we know from *sāṅkhya*, from the *Gītā*, *sattva*, *rajas*, *tamas*, and which constitute the whole of *Prakṛti*, the whole of, uh, human nature and cosmic nature, and so on. So, there is one flow of *spanda* which manifests in the *guṇas*. And the *guṇas* are meant because they are the constituents of reality, so he doesn't go into the details, and so on. If you mention the *guṇas*, through the *guṇas*, everything else is included of whatever is in *Prakṛti*, of the, uh, uh, then the human nature and so on. 

So, that flow of *spanda* is the particularization of *spanda*, *viśeṣa spanda*. And the other one is *sāmānya spanda*, the universal or, uh, generic, general, you know, how this is universal. I think universal vibration of consciousness. And that is the, the main purport of this whole scripture, *sāmānya spanda*, but it does manifest in the *guṇas* and all the elements, all the qualities and all the manifestations of, uh, cosmic and, uh, psychological, and so on and so on. 

Now, for the *SubhPrabuddha* who has realized his own essential nature, *labdhā Ātmas Ātma Ātmalābha*, for him, there is no… Uh, this is, this is a beautiful expression in Sanskrit: *aparipanthinaḥ*. You know what, uh, *aparipanthinaḥ*? Previously, it used to be when you go on pilgrimage to Kailash, you know, Tibet was well-known for this *aparipanthinaḥ*, and this way, um, uh, uh, the people who would, uh, uh, wait for the pilgrims, you know, and then steal all their possessions. Uh, they get *Lakṣmī* and German. This *aparipanthinaḥ*. Uh, *panthī* means on the way. So, um, you have to pass, pilgrims have to pass through a certain, uh, path, passage, and then this, uh, um, robbers, they would be waiting, uh, right at the proper point. And then, and this was still going on in Nepal when this Maoists were dominating in Western Nepal. They would be waiting for the groups of pilgrims and then take all their money and, uh, let them go. So, these are *aparipanthins*. So, uh, it's very, uh, very speaking, um, literally, it means that. 

So, on our spiritual parts also, there are these *aparipanthins*, those who are, who want to rob us of our spiritual wealth. That this is implied there, that the robbers of the spiritual path. And these robbers are the *guṇas* and, uh, and this, uh, *viśeṣa*, uh, *spandas*, the things which distract us, and the senses, if we take them as separate from their energies. Um, these, um, as we had, senses which are like lamps of clay and not like feathers. Um, so, all these things which are stealing our spiritual property, spiritual, uh… So, I, I love this expression because it's so, um, but the one who has realized, and twice this *labbh* is used, *labdhātmalābha*, who has, who has attained his essential nature, no, uh, robber can rob him of his spiritual treasure because he has already become one with that *sāmānya spanda*, or he has taken recourse, he is based on that *sāmānya spanda*, on that universal vibration of consciousness. And it's also a very beautiful expression because if you think what, this, the enlightened beings, what makes them so universal? See whether Buddha is born in, uh, anywhere, uh, in, in Eastern, uh, Bihar, or somebody, it has nothing to do with the place and the time and the… it is the universal realization of that, uh, reality which is always there. It, it has nothing to do with the particular. I mean, it is manifested in a particular way, but that is the, the im- importance, and the effect is universal. And that Super Buddha is, um, a universal, uh, being. 

*Sāmanya Spanda*, and we can understand what's in that sense. 

*Saṃśraya*, uh, yeah, being, uh, uh, having the support, abiding… Yes, Mark says beautifully, they are grounded in the universal vibration. They are grounded in the universal vibration. That's a very beautiful expression. So, to be grounded in that *Sāmanya Spanda*. 

The last line, the word "they" in Mark's translation, it refers to… Yes, yeah. Hm. Uh, in Mark's translation, the last line… Yeah. Uh, therefore, they… They refer to… Yeah, yeah. That's what in the, in the word, it is *jnāsi* in the, uh, uh, means to who knows, those who know. And *jnāsi* means, uh, *Supra Buddha jñāsi*. The, the enlightenment, I mean they purely, uh, uh, awake, fully awakened ones. Uh, therefore, they are, they are never obstruct the enlightened. What is the, what… No, sorry, they… No, no, no, no. In these sense, it is, it is *dakṣiṇas, dakṣiṇas*. 

Then, the, now, the, um, commentary says, "This *guṇas*…" In the case of the ordinary being, who is, um, at the level of *viśeṣa spanda*, these *guṇas* are *sattva, tamas*, uh, uh, *sattva, rajas* and *tamas*. But in the case of the enlightened one, these, uh, are *sattva* corresponds to *jñāna śakti*. *Rajas* correspond to *kriyā śakti* and *tamas*, um, corresponds to *māyā* in the scheme or *māyā* or *śuddhā vidyā*. And that is the passage in the scheme of the *tattvas* where when *māyā*, uh, becomes transformed into *śuddhā vidyā*. So, for the enlightened one, the *guṇas*… 

What is the difference between *śuddha vidyā* and *jñāna*? You said three corresponding to these *Sattva*, you see, there are the three, uh, *tattvas*. Those who have already some idea of the scheme of the 36 *tattvas*. So, above *māyā*, there is *śuddhā vidyā*, then *īśvara*, then *Sadāśiva*. So, these are stages of divine manifestation, and they correspond to the, the, um… *Sadāśiva* corresponds to *jñāna śakti*, *īśvara* to *kriyā śakti*, and… That, that's what he does, *Śrīmātā*, does. In relation to the *yogī*, yes, uh, he quotes the *Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā*. 

"कुछ लो ज़्यादा टाइम नहीं है" Yeah, only one, but the very, um, carefully, um, in the *Tantras*, um, you have all these three levels of understanding reality. That is *sthūla*, *sūkṣma*, *para*. I don't have to write it. I think everybody knows. *Sthūla* means the physical, material. *Sūkṣma* means, uh, subtle, but what means subtle? Subtle sometimes is translated as psychic or, uh… So in between. Now, *para*, the question, um, what do you understand by *para*? First, what is implied in this scheme, and that you find in the *Tantras*, and then the authors ex- explain it, and so on, that you cannot jump from your physical perception to the transcendence. There must be a development through the subtle layers, levels of, uh, yeah, what we say, transformation. You cannot, uh, assume that because you have been so much identified with the only physical perception of things and then suddenly you will get into *samādhi*. First, the mind and the body and the senses and everything has to undergo that process of becoming subtler and subtler and subtler. And if you remember one important *karaṇa* in the beginning of our, the beginning that says that, gradually becoming subtler and subtler and subtler. So, and that is the, um… 

So then, some people translate *para* as subtlest, but even that doesn't solve the problem. See, *para*, if you say you want to realize God. Now, who are you and who is God? And you are starting from a very physical identification with your own body, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And then, but unless there is an inter- intermediary stage of *sūkṣma*, that *para* cannot be realized. So, this is a very basic truth in the *Tantras*. It's nothing very, uh, specific. It's, it's very basic. Uh, and I would say it's more important than this *triguṇa*, *sattva*, *raja*, *tamas*. Although the whole Indian philosophy, I mean, psychology has been so much, um, determined by this *triguṇa*, uh, theory. But *sthūla*, *sūkṣma*, *para*, I find it more useful. You can also say *sthūla* is, of course, *tamas*. *Sūkṣma* is *rajas*, and *para* is *sattva*, in a way. But it's not exactly, um… Maybe you find those distinctions for them. 

And yesterday you said it's got to be sudden. There's this unexpected quality when the *spanda* manifests itself. So, there's a suddenness, and then there is the gradual, gradual, graduality. There's no such word, but how do we reconcile these two? 

No, there's no reconciliation. It just, it is… See what you have to do with your own self is to make yourself more and more subtle. You, if you get enlightenment in an instant, I mean, that, that is wonderful, and, uh, I mean, everybody will touch your feet and be, be happy and, uh, but, uh, see, we have our own homework to do. We are a teacher, so some students, they may not, um, they are so bright and so intelligent that they may not even need, but our own homework is to become more and more subtle. And his homework is just to give us grace. And we, we cannot claim it. We cannot claim it. We cannot expect it. We cannot be sure of it. But when it happens, it happens. But, uh, don't try to find any logical, um, reconciliation. It is not a question of logic. Question of experience. 

Can we relate *viśeṣa spanda* with any of these, uh, four stages of, uh, *anupāya* yeah, *śaktopāya*, and *viśeṣa spanda*? What, what level can be corresponded… No, it's… No, no, no, no, no. Don't confuse. Don't confuse. *Viśeṣa spanda* is everything. Whatever is concretely experienced. It may be, uh, cosmic realities. It may be, uh, anything. It is a concretization of that very energy, vibra- vibrational energy. So, it has nothing to do with *upāyas*. It is just, um, whether it's a book or a tree or it's all *viśeṣa spanda*. In different degrees of… So that and I don't have to go into great details, but, um, the important thing is to, as we say, to reach that transformation from our particular experiences, whether external or internal, to that universal level of vibration of consciousness. That's, that's a whole process which is required here. 

You, uh, said kinds of consciousness when you were replying to her. Can you just, uh, are you saying that is the consciousness, the waking and the dream and the fourth state, or it is something different? Kinds of consciousness? Yeah, you said, "Depends on the kind of consciousness." 

No, no, no, on the level we… But the kind is not the right way. No, no, no, no, on the level. Yeah, yeah. No, no. 

So, should we stop here, or should we do the one more un- uh, enlightened? That's no… No, you stay where you are. We will go down. 

*aprabuddhadehāstu iti sastīti astāṃno u udyatāḥ pācayante duruttare ghore saṃsāravartmani.* 

Of course, that's why she doesn't want to read this. 

These namely the *guṇas*, etcetera, however intent on veiling the real nature, push the people of unawakened intellect into the terrible ocean of transmigratory existence from which it is difficult to, or which it is difficult to cross. 

We have this, um, *āgama* sometimes said, Ambujī… Well, after all, there must be a contrast because, uh, not everybody is enlightened. And, uh, it is says what is much… Yet for those whose intuition slumbers… no… Intuition slumbers? Yes, yes, as a *aprabuddhadehā*… Yeah. It's a li- literal way of translation. *aprabuddhadehā*, whose mind is, uh, unawakened strong… Yeah. 

So those whose intuition slumbers, these vibrations of consciousness are intent on disrupting their own abiding state of being, casting them down onto the terrible paths of transmigration, so hard to cross. 

Intuition slumbers… He, he has translated this intuition, whose mind or intellect is unawakened, *pācayanti*. So, the subject of *pācayanti* are the *guṇas*. And he explains very beautifully…

What is *aprabuddhadehā*? *dehā*, the first word, the first sentence of the commentary. *aprabuddhadehāḥ prāyaḥ sarvān apraty apratyavijñāta-parameśvara parameśvarīśaktyā ātmaka nityaspanda tattvān dehātmā* umm *dehātmamānini māninaḥ*. So, what are these, uh, unawakened ones? Means those who consider, uh, themselves to be only, uh, their body. Identified with the body. And who are, who have not recognized, and here comes the, the basic, uh, way of enlightenment, of awakening is *pratyabhijñā*. Recognizing your own essential nature. And they are *apratyabhijñātā parameśvarī*. They have not recognized their own divine nature. This, this is what is, uh, *abhijñāna śaktyātmaka*. And they have not recognized the, their own power of vibration, *nitya spanda*. Logical translation. 

So, these are the worldly people, etcetera, who have not recognized their own, um, *parameśvara śaktyātmana*. Uh, their own nature of divine energy. *Parameśvara śaktyātmana*. And hence, they have not recognized their own nature of vibration of consciousness. *Spanda*, *nitya spandatattvaṃ*, *tattvam*. And they are identified with their own bodies, but just with the body. Ordinary consciousness, ordinary. But then, he only, middle *yogina*, consider their bodies as the self. And even those partially awakened *yogis* who consider *prāṇa*, etcetera, as the self. So, that is also, uh, a limitation. That's also not *samānya spanda*. *Mitya yoginas* *iti*. 

And then, I don't know, Alexander, if, um, we should go into this whole question of the *bhūta*, etcetera if, uh, if, uh, we want, I will ask you to do it. But, um, because it's a very big topic.

We want the body is used, the body plural. So, which are the body, maybe the un- uh un- enlightened person… Yeah, identifying… Yeah, himself with the body… Yeah, as the self… Yeah, yes, yes. So, the body means what I can understand the *dehātmamānini māninaḥ*, one who considers their body as the self. So, the body is… What are the bodies we are talking about? The physical, but it can be the physical, mental body, or any other body? Yes, yes. You see, in the case of the ordinary, um, human beings, it would be the physical body. Yes. And then in the case of *yogis* who, uh, *yogis* of a lower degree, uh, they identify themselves with the *prāṇa śarīra*. It is specially mentioned, *prāṇa śarīra*, or with the mental body. So, these are also not, um, this is also not the complete recognition of the, um, of that divine, um, power of the *spanda*. So, that different levels of identification, as you, you are rightly saying, that is not only the physical body. There are so many bodies, *sūkṣma śarīra*, and so on. So, even that can be also an hindrance to the full enlightenment. 

Because of *kośas*? Because *pañca kośas*, *pañca*… Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, the vast difference, uh, people who are uninitiated, or like in slumber, as you put it…  Mark's translation, Mark's translation, uh, uh, the line that I want to, uh, uh… It says, "These vibrations of consciousness are intent on disrupting their own abiding state of being." This *prāṇa* is intent on disrupting their state of being, of people who are unlike… Is that correct, Professor? 

Yeah. First, before we… Mark, uh, relies on other commentators. The commentator is very critical of earlier commentators. So, there are different interpretations. You're right, it is a different interpretation. But even the *guṇas*, uh, since the *guṇas* are *viśeṣa-spanda*, so, in that sense, uh, the *guṇas*, they, um, can be disrupting, or they can be disturbing that… It's a similar kind of a situation. Yeah. 

So, um, Alexandra, would there, would you like to say something about *kucharī dikrī*? *kucharī dikrī*? Is the commentary? Uh? The, the one expecting experience? 

I mean, the, it's the whole subject is coming up here, you know. Maybe you have some today. Maybe we can think about it, and maybe in the afternoon, you can. It has come before also, and I didn't go into it. Uh, in the very beginning, *śakti*, *śakti cakra*, of course, with 11 meanings in the *Spanda Sandoha*, so, one of the meanings is, of course, uh, this, uh, *śakti* is… We can think about it and maybe do something in the afternoon. 

See, there, um, the fact is that energies are not all conducive to enlightenment. Yeah. See, the *śakti*, the same *śakti cakra* which we are praising in the beginning, it can lead upward, and it can also lead downward. And there are energies, that's why they are called *kaula śakti* and *kaulatara śakti*, and so on, which are, uh, disturbing, which are bringing, um, down *patyantī*, which make you fall. And that he goes in the commentary. He goes into these energies which are, uh, disrupting, or which are, um, creating the *yogī* to fall. It's a beautiful expression: "*svasthiti*", you know? They, uh… But you, you are, what you are losing in going down is you lose your very own state. So, the, the "*svasthiti*", one's true own state is that *ātmany spanda*, or whatever you… It's that, um, awakening consciousness. That's being in your own *svāstha*. See, normally in, in Hindi also, it means also being healthy, means being in your own self. Being in your own being. Being established in your own self. Uh, *svāstha, "svasthiti"*. It also means state. State of being. Yeah. 

And that is why we are reciting, um, when we start with reciting the, uh, *śloka* to the *guru pārati*, who makes to cross over this terrible, uh, deep ocean of, of doubt that we ourselves… So, there… You need a help, to be a help to cross over from that state of *ātmabuddha*. So, about the commentary, we will think about it. And, uh, then we will come again to this beautiful verse 21 and 22 in the afternoon. 

We'd like to hear about the disruptive *śakti cakra*. She will say after lunch. The disruptive one in the afternoon. 

She said she will think about it. Yeah, because of the *kucharī*, *kucharī*, *kucharī*, *dikrī*, *dikrī*, *kucharī*. Sorry. Okay, so we… This, this, uh, uh, first line, the second, second, the second "*svasthiti*" covered with *vināśa*. Yeah, that's what it is. Yes, yes, yes. Second one is the, the block, block you, the, uh, difficult to… Yeah. 

Does this mean we need to recognize…
