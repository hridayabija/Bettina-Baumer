Right, um, in in the evening either we do the *guru stuti* or the *amṛteśvara bhairava*, which is *amṛteśvara bhairava*. Thank you. And then tomorrow being the *janmāṣṭamī* we can do the *guru stuti* tomorrow at 11:00. Yeah. Then tomorrow we can have the festivities tomorrow, yeah. Which kind of festivities tomorrow? Kṛṣṇa's Kṛṣṇa *janmāṣṭamī*. So if you want to celebrate in another way? I mean, one thing, we are finishing the first section of *Spanda Kārikā* today. According to Kṣemarāja there are other sections, where his other commentators. So, that sense we can have a gap, if the weather permits, and we want to have the a visit to the temple and the monastery? Viṣṇu Viṣṇu Viṣṇu ji, hmm. 

I called the uh uh I called the Sherabling, and I see yes, the retreat is just for the Sherabling people, so we can visit all the temples. Hmm, just for the the the people in retreat are just the Sherab people, but the the rest of the monastery is open. We can visit the the the Sherabling monastery. Yeah, but the important thing is the temple? No, no, the Sherab are you know, in the old This is only, these people are in retreat there, that's all. The rest, temples are open and normal. Okay. And my friend who is the monk, there is a French you know, will you know or He say if you I ask him, are you available to guide us and explain, he say yes, if you come between 1:00 and 3:00. I can between 1:00 and 1:00 and 3:00. Uh-huh. But there's no *pūjā* then? Are you want to go during *pūjā*? 

Yes, of course. So, you want to go afternoon *pūjā*? What what time *pūjā*, because we really say uh mean I would like to know by what time uh there is *pūjā* at which we can attend, where we can be. If it's a special day, lunar day, lunar day tomorrow. No, no. No. If it will be probably in the morning or 5:00 in the morning. Maybe later? 

We could go to the morning then? We could go to the morning *pūjā* and then go to the temple? Morning *pūjā* and then go to the temple, yeah. And then we will celebrate *janmāṣṭamī* in the intellectually, religiously I want to go early morning. Early means 4:00. 

But this generally what they ask for *pūjā*, they don't want We can ask her, she's not Two years ago we attended one *pūjā* in the *Spanda Kārikā*. So, she can find out the time. There's special practice *pūjā*. 

When do we hear the *mahā mṛtyuñjaya mahā mṛtyuñjaya* path tomorrow? Tomorrow *mahā mṛtyuñjaya*. See, *amṛteśvara bhairava* and *mahā mṛtyuñjaya*, and either we do this or that. So, we have to make up our mind because uh if we have to go tomorrow morning, we have to organize things. And yeah, yeah today uh if we go tomorrow early morning, we have to organize today. 

Exactly. Yeah, otherwise uh tomorrow morning, no it's not possible, it's not possible. Yeah, I mean that is a walk if you want to walk for one hour. 

Yeah, now we go by time. But can you find the number, Isabel, then? But after after the session we can phone and then Hmm, and actually we can gather here. Yeah, right, together. 

Yeah. Or or in the Yeah, and then decide, because it is a festival, and uh then we are concluding one section today, one chapter. So, we have come up to actually um page 21, 99 in this book. 

After

> Atastaṁ udyuktaspandatattvavibhiktaye jāgrateva nijaṁ bhāvam acirēṇādhi adhigacchati

Udyukta is a beautiful expression. You remember that in the beginning however the practices of Viṣṇu, they are called *sādhanā*, but here they are called *yukti*. *Yukti*, of course, not in the sense of logic, but in the sense of yoga in the sense of So, here *udyukta* being uh uh This *ut* is always some you know this prefix *ut* is always something to rising uh in the sense of being awake, being arisen, um *sataṭaṁ udyatā* always *uditā*, always arisen, always awake, always aware. So, *udyukta* is um from the same root, *yuj*, it's a very important expression. Therefore, one should be always on the alert, on the alert for the discernment of the *Spanda* principle. Such a person attains his essential state even in the waking condition in a short time. 

In Mark's translation,

> Therefore, he who strives constantly to discern the *Spanda* principle rapidly attains his own true state of being, even while in the waking state itself.

Of course, this concerns the *prabuddha*. The *suprabuddha* is already established. This concerns the *prabuddha*. He is uh awakened, but he has still to exert his awareness. So, he should be alert and aware. And this is the main practice of the *prabuddha*:

> *sataṭaṁ udyuktaspandatattvavibhiktaye*

And this uh then he will attain his true state of being. I like the translation of Mark, "his true state of being," *nijaṁ bhāvam*. See, the text is so brief and precise, *nijaṁ bhāvam*, your own true being, *acirēṇa* without delay, *jāgrat* even even in the waking condition. 

And just at least to have one quotation from the *Bhagavad Gītā*, because tomorrow is *janmāṣṭamī*. Except I have to quote the *Gītā*. So, let us read now,

> He who is always on the alert for the discernment of the *Spanda* principle, which has been already described, and so on. In a short time his essential nature, which is the same as *śaṁkarā*, even in a state of waking. If, as has been said in the *Gītā*, "Those who merging their mind in me, always united with me, wait upon me." 

That's his translation:

> *mayi āveśya mano ye māṁ nityayuktā upāsate*

A very beautiful expression of the *Gītā*. And uh of course consciously he has chosen this expression because *mayi āveśya*, that *āveśya* is there, that *samāveśa*, that entering into me. And *nityayuktā*, of course the *Gītā* is full of these expressions of um the *yogī* is one who is who has to be *yuktā*. *Yuktā* has to be united, unified, in harmony, ever-controlled, uh self-controlled. So, everything is contained in that *yuktā*. They worship me being ever integrated, ever united, ever alert, ever aware. He is always intent on the close observation of the inner divine nature, *sataṭam eva antarmukhasvarūpa niphalana*. 

So, this *niphalana*, I mean those who are Hindi *vāla*, so they understand very clearly *niphalana*. *Niphalan* can also something to uh how to translate Hindi *niphalana*? Intent on the close observation of the inner nature, *antarmukha*. 

And then this is the same *śaṁkarāṣṇā*,

> *antarmukhā yena prabhutvo nityoditasamāveśa āsādhanā asādhanāt suprabuddho jīvanmukto bhavati*

No, this *nityodita*, ever arisen, ever awakened, *samāveśa*, the ever arisen state of union, or state of merging, state of absorption, ever present. That is inner nature, which is *śaṁkarā* itself emerges before before him by which the awakened one by the attainment of ever present absorption in it becomes fully enlightened and becomes liberated while living, *jīvanmukto bhavati*. Of course, the *suprabuddha* is the *jīvanmukta*, *suprabuddha* is So, the difference being precisely in the continuity of awakening. 

And that's why uh this whole question of being once awakened and then falling again, um which is a very relevant question in any spiritual circles, or if one thinks one is awakened, enlightened, and then um is not attentive anymore or is not aware anymore, and then uh this *guṇas* come into play again, as we said before, the *guṇas* which are uh the *śaiśava* and the So, that is why the the main task of the one who has had any kind of experience of awakening uh is to remain alert and aware and uh attentive. And this is the main uh main task of maintenance. There's nothing else. Hmm? Of the main task of maintenance of that state? 

Yeah, to remain in that state. 

Yeah. Yeah. And then it's also very clear on what he has to be of what he has to be aware. And this you can apply to your own experience, everyone of us. Everyone has had some experience of what we call "enlightenment," or some uh insight or deep uh absorption, and so on. And the practice consists in keeping that experience alive, maybe by remembering it, by re-evoking it, and by trying to reach again that state in which you have been at that moment, at that time of the experience. And this is what this the awareness is precisely that. That's why there is no other um yoga practice, except that awareness. And only by constant um keeping that alive it becomes *nididhyāsana*, ever reason. 

Then he comes again to the *prabuddha*. Um I'm reading the little introduction by Kṣemar So, it gives all kinds of examples of uh being attacked by a tiger, by a lion, by uh elephant, and so on and so on. 

> Therefore, considering carefully the cessation of all other mental activities, instantly allaying the states of anger, uncertainty within him by the device of the tortoise contracting all its limbs within on the occasion of fear or by expanding his state of joy, running, et cetera. He should contemplate on the *Spanda* energy, and so on. 

Now, what I wanted to mention is that

> *naiti kṛcchrapadaṁ saṁcityam*

*Chatiti*, yeah, yeah, this is the the tortoise, we know that example from other yoga texts. That tortoise withdrawing its limbs. *Maha vikāsa vyāpti yuktyā*. Now, this is a very important expression. *Maha vikāsa vyāpti yuktyā*. By the *yukti* by the uh he says, "contemplate," no? *Maha vikāsa vyāpti*. Now, *maha vikāsa* is that um utmost expansion of energy. See, one is the contraction of the uh tortoise, so there are two things happen. One is contraction, the other is expansion. So, contraction happens, of course in the case of fear. And expansion in the case of an excessive uh emotion. And that's *maha vikāsa vyāpti*. *Vyāpti*. It is uh a kind of technical term. There is a very short text called *Vatulanātha Sūtra*. Which uh to which this uh this experience belongs. I don't know if uh Jankinacci has ever No. 

I know the word, but I've read only the first word of that *sahasra*. 

Yeah, it is very short, very short, just brief. 

Yeah, but it is an extremely intense, it only speaks of that state of intensity. And uh this *maha vikāsa vyāpti* is um it occurs in *Vatulanātha Sūtra*. Swamiji has also commented on it. Uh it's published there, very short text. And uh Lilian Silburn has, you may have seen that in that *Vatulanātha Sūtra*, no? And it's a little unorthodox text, even in this tradition. But, it is um only related to to that uh intensity of experience. A very high state of intensity. *Maha vikāsa vyāpti*. See, which means, first there is an expansion, and then there is a *vyāpti*, means penetration. Expansion and penetration. What happens in this kind of um emotional states. 

And then, of course, he quotes uh *Vijñāna Bhairava*. Um we have so many examples that um he quotes 301. 

> If one succeeds in immobilizing his mind and making uh when he's under the sway of desire, anger, greed, infatuation, arrogance, and envy. Then the reality underlying these states alone subsists. 

And this is one of those expressions where uh which is sort of totally um neutral. Only that reality remains, of course in the *Spanda Kārikā* they say this reality is *Spanda*. Because it is this intensity uh is not something uh just uh there is a movement in it, there is an intensity of yeah. Are there are there schools of thought that have the same principle uh in in their thought and their philosophy? Yeah, uh this this anger, when during anger, uncertainty, some uh spiritual principle like this arises, or just *Spanda*? Well, I mean, *Vijñāna Bhairava* is not uh that is much earlier. It's a source uh and the maybe other Tantras, um which have similar It's typical Tantric method, in any case definitely. Uh about Buddhist Tantras, I don't know. Maybe Ajit uh if you know in Buddhist Tantras. Only. 

I don't think I've ever heard it explained like that. Maybe if someone, is uh expert in Tantra. But, yeah, it is mentioned in uh uh extreme experiences of uh emotions uh is in uh uh Because the state of clarity also arises alongside these uh states of extreme, uh I mean, one is the uh theoretical um basis in the Tantras, and the other is a practical. I mean, if you read the life of Milarepa, of course uh there are all kinds of emotions and uh intense emotions which uh uh lead into that state. And so I think the lives of the saints and the texts have to be combined. 

Okay, David Frawley has a book, uh *Inner Tantra Yoga*, David Frawley. He, Whose book is it? Frawley. Frawley. Uh-huh. And he mentions the um uh energy of emotion. He mentions, and he specifically mentions emotion as like the emotion is rising, but you are with the energy. You are focusing on the energy behind it, and that leads you. It's very clearly explained, although in a different terminology. 

Yeah, I'm sure that there must be um see, in the the 

The *Vijñāna Bhairava* 111, it says:

> *puti mṛstimitaṁ krodhaḥ tat tattvam avasiṣyate*

See, all this speaks: *kāma, krodha, lobha, moha*, uh *mada*, *mātsarya*, *utsāha*, et cetera. Um 

> "If one stabilizes, immobilizes one's mind, then that reality alone remains." But it's in practice, the reality which underlies these states. So, it means *yogīs* are also subject to what other uh limited individuals experience?

Of course. But what kind of *krodha*? My God. If you think of Marpa and Milarepa and uh I mean all the saints, they had great um intense um emotions. There's no question. But, what quality of emotion. So, that is uh the heaven and hell are all the difference. It's not the emotions are absent. 

But something they agreed. 

But exactly! That's the whole the difference is in our state of uh mind and in their state of mind, in their state of uh consciousness. They cannot see uh something like we. 

So, 101 is this. Then 71. Of course, this is where this uh *ati-utsa*, and then *prakṛṣṭā*. Extremely joyful is the example:

> On the occasion of the great delight being obtained, uh uh arising from seeing a friend or relative after a long time. One should meditate on the delight itself and become absorbed in it. Then his mind will become unidentified with it. 

So, this is for *prakṛṣṭā*. 

And then the famous verse 118. 

> At the commencement and end of sneezing, in terror, in sorrow, in the condition of a deep sigh, or on the occasion of flight from the attack of an elephant.

During That there is a variant reading in the uh in the published um *Vijñāna Bhairava*. Uh there's no elephant in the published version. 

> Uh, during keen curiosity, at the commencement and end of hunger, the state of *brahman* comes near. 

Yeah, *brahman*, I think also we now, this is also beautiful expression. *Brahmasattā samipakā. Brahmasattā samipakā*. The reality of *brahman*. So, we don't need, *brahman* is not any, the absolute reality is close. Comes close. This is very beautiful uh expression. 

Does this refer to both *prabuddha* and *suprabuddha*? Because? What? Both *prabuddha* and *suprabuddha* state, or just *prabuddha*? 

No, no, this is for the *prabuddha*. Only *prabuddha*. 

Yeah, because that relates to what Manacci was asking, because in the *suprabuddha* state, they're all they're already established in this. So, they wouldn't The yeah, already established, so they wouldn't No, but they may still get angry and happy. I mean this is not, um but they are in that uh already set. Although, they are in the ever-present uh state. So, it is ever-present. Yeah, it's for the *prabuddha*. 

So, the term uh *Spanda* does not occur in the Tantra. But, of course, uh what the reality which is experienced, and uh it has found that expression in the *Spanda uh Kārikā* which is defined as *Spanda*, which is a very precise description. Because there is some uh uh there is some power, there's some intensity, there's some um stillness and movement and movement and stillness, as Abhinavagupta says. So, it's not just, I mean he tries to say it in different words, *Brahmasattā samipakā*, or *tat tattvam avasiṣyate*. Just the reality remains. But, the *Spanda* is here much more precise. Because that's really what what happens is *Spanda*. There is an um intense energy which is not by the *prabuddha* by the enlightened one, it is not allowed to explode to go outside, but it remains in that condensed state. 

Yeah, this is what um So, these examples are well-known and uh very clear. So, now my question is, so we still have time? So, we will finish uh this first um first section according to Kṣemarāja because there are different divisions of the text, but we are not uh concerned about that. And these are verses 23, 24 and 25. Now, they are connected. 

> *yāmavasthāṁ samālambya yataya mamavakṣati tatavaśyaṁ kariṣyāmi iti saṅkalpitadhiṣṭhati*

So, we can take it also separately. Now, interesting thing is, who who is giving that order? "Taking from whom" and of that means *Spanda*, the awakened *yogī* remains firm with the resolution: "I will surely carry out whatever it will tell me." This is uh very *yataya mama vakṣati*. "Whatever it will tell me." *Yām avasthāṁ*, this *avasthā*, this condition, or this state, is the state which has been experienced in the previous uh examples, in with the previous examples. Now, resting um *samālambya* on that state. This is very important. 'Cause the state which once you have experienced it, and and you can hold on to that to that experience. But, then there's a kind of obedience. "I will surely do whatever it tells me." So, it's something like a personalization of that *Spanda tattva*. Um it's like what Marx says, huh? Yeah, yeah, but it is very personalized uh this expression. 

> Once enter that state  state which the *yogī* takes as his support and firmly resolves that he will surely do whatever he says

It's a very interesting expression because so there is an experience of a state, and that state has to be made the basis of um awareness, and then being attentive to that is like listening to a guru, "whatever he tells me, I will do it." So, he becomes your guru, that state or that experience becomes like a guru. 

"I will surely do whatever he tells me." "Whatever he tells me." So, it's the inner guru then anyway. It is a It is a again, this is this the the not the Because he still has to hold firm, hold that uh state uh firm, and and only by that firmness, by that continuity, um really be uh advanced to the and and then the time As again time understanding means uh that state  time As again *chandra sūrya suṣumṇā* *yas* *yas mito hitvā brahmanda gocharam* 

Time as relying on that means on that state, resting on the experience of *Spanda*. Both *prāṇa* (*sūrya*) and *apāna* (*candra*) get merged in the *suṣumṇā*, and by the upward path of *suṣumṇā* they rise up to the great ether of universal consciousness I have to continue till the end um they they belong together. 

So that this *Mahāyoginī* in the in the *Bhāskare*, 

> *suṣumṇā muraprabhutasya anavrataḥ*

Again, the difference between the *Prabhuta* and the *Apravrataḥ* is very beautiful by abandon yes, they rise up to the great ether of universal consciousness by abandoning the sphere of the body together with the Brahma Brahma. It is actually *Brahmāṇḍa*, um I explain everything, and are completely dissolved in it. 

The the unenlightened *yogī*, by considering that state a kind of deep sleep, remains stupefied, while the one who is not covered with the darkness of infatuation is established in the ether of universal consciousness, and thereby is fully enlightened. 

So, there are uh two steps: One is that being faithful to that experience, to that state. And then what happens is that relying or resting on that state, the sun and the moon enter into the middle path. And this is precisely the the the turning point, as we had it also in the if you remember the um uh the first turning point was the turning from the external experience of the internal, *Antar Mokta*. Second turning point is that merging of *prāṇa* and *apāna* with the *madhya nāḍī*. And here, even he says *suṣumṇā* in the *suṣumṇā*. And actually, this experience is that these are very very closely connected because the moment you experience that state, even in a state of anger or happiness, or whatever, at that very moment, it happens. So, he he explains it one by one, but it is actually simultaneous. At the moment of that experience, the *prāṇa* and the *apāna* get merged in the *suṣumṇā*, and uh and that is your question we will come to that, um So, the word *kuṇḍalinī* doesn't occur, but actually the experience of *kuṇḍalinī* is, of course, very much here. And this language of the moon and the sun, they know it very well from the Tantras. 

And what is the third third is fire? The fire, fire? But if you speak in symbolic, the the Tantra symbolism, that is fire, but he doesn't say here. He says *suṣumṇā* and uh so the uh the moon and the sun and the two *prāṇa* uh *prāṇa* and *apāna*. And why is he not saying *iḍā* and *piṅgalā* instead of *prāṇa*, *apāna*? 

Why *iḍā* and *piṅgalā*? Why is he not saying *iḍā* and This is precisely See, in the *haṭhayoga* texts, they use this language, *iḍā*, *piṅgalā*. But but he says here *suṣumṇā*. Huh? He's saying *suṣumṇā*. Yeah. So, *suṣumṇā* he says. He says sun, moon, and *suṣumṇā*. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not but *iḍā*, *piṅgalā*, you find very rarely, um Alexander, do you remember *iḍā*, *piṅgalā* occasionally? But, mostly it is um *prāṇa*, *apāna*, and uh or um *sūrya*, *soma* um It's very rare that the terminology uses It's very typical *haṭhayogic* terminology. And the the the third uh symbolic expression is *brahmāṇḍa*. Um *hitvā brahmanda gocharam*. Now, *brahmāṇḍa* is, of course, the universe, but it is also the body. And he says very clearly this is the the the macrocosm and the microcosm. And uh um they were asking um in the actual transcendence, here it is very clear. Transcending the both the universe and the body, *hitvā brahmanda gocharam*. *Gochara* means the sphere. The sphere of the cosmos and the sphere of the of the body transcend uh when they merge, and then they they rise, and they transcend the sphere of the body, means they go beyond *sahasrāra* *sahasrāra*. And here it is not a question, uh it's not explicitly said that in the *Vijñāna Bhairava*, of course, we have the *dvādaśānta*. The external *dvādaśānta*, which goes beyond the *brahmāṇḍa*. Now, the yogic *dvādaśānta*, above the *brahmāṇḍa* uh above the *brahmāṇḍa*. So, the whole cosmic symbolism of the Tantras, we are very familiar with that, those who have uh some knowledge of the Tantra. 

Yes. This uh term *brahmāṇḍa*. Yeah. The second part of that is the same as uh *brahmāṇḍa gocharam*. *Gocharam* means the sphere, the area of operation. But I'm I'm more like the *maṇḍala* part, that's Isn't that the same as the Sanskrit for *maṇḍala*? The first time the word *maṇḍala*. Where did you find *maṇḍala* here? 

No, I just *brahmāṇḍa*. *Brahmāṇḍa* uh *brahmāṇḍa*. *Brahmāṇḍa* *brahmāṇḍa*. *Brahmāṇḍa* is the egg of Brahman, is the universe. And *aṇḍa* means egg Okay. Thank you. You see, as you said that the second turning point is the *prāṇa* and *apāna* merging merging in *suṣumṇā*, and transcending the sphere of body. Uh is it a metaphorical expression to say that the there is such a absorption that there is total forgetfulness of the empirical reality including body? Is it more than this? I just want to understand that.

But but what what love see On one hand it it it sees that this turning point comes when *prāṇa* and *apāna*, sun and moon, they merge in *suṣumṇā*, and they rise. And transcending the sphere of body. And just trying to understand that: Is it a metaphorical expression for that there is such a total absorption that you become completely forgetful of the empirical reality, or empirical world?

That is a very good question. Now, for uh which language you use to express that experience, I mean this is that the Tantras have their own uh language, uh It of course, the body is still there. It is not it is not mean even the *yogīs* uh still are in in their body that transcending means elevating and going beyond the limitations: The cosmic limitations and the physical limitations, bodily limitations. And we are constantly bound by these limitations. And by this merging of the two *prāṇa* and *apāna* in this these and by the uprising, these limitations are are transcended. That doesn't mean that the body will fall dead or uh energy uh like that, but it is a complete again, I have to use the word "transformation." The transformation by rising above the the the the limitations. And limitations always do this distinction. You see, as long as *prāṇa* and *apāna* *prāṇa* and *apāna*, they are as then uh alternating, uh you cannot overcome that dualism. But, the moment they become one in the *suṣumṇā*, then the total unification happens. So, why it is called yoga? Why it is called this *Yukti*, *Yukta*, and so on? It is all it's a unification. It's a process of total unification. But, I don't know. There are so many languages one can use, but I I'm just trying to Yeah. What's the meaning of the *suṣumṇā*? *Suṣumṇā*? Yeah. What's the meaning? What's the the translation for that? The word. The word, yeah. What's the meaning of *suṣumṇā*? Well, *su*, at least, it is it is good, in many cases. *Su* is "good". If you want to This is such a small print. If anybody can I my eyes cannot *brahmāṇḍa gocharam* *suṣumṇā*. Do you remember, Alexander? No, Alexander was supposed to give us some something material for uh those energies which we discussed in the morning session. Yes Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's good. 

And uh the beautiful expression is uh *śānti* um that that that *Mahāyoginī* and the the again, that cosmic image comes, the great space, empty space of consciousness, in which the sun and the moon uh disappear. So, and that *Mahāvyoma*, that is, of course, beyond the uh the body. *Mahāvyoma*. 

What is *śaśī*? *Śaśī*. *Śaśī* is the moon. 

*Śaśī*  *Bhaskar*, huh? Uh *Bhaskar* is the sun. *Bhaskar*. *Suṣumṇā*. *Śaśī Bhaskare*. You see, this whatever we may describe until you experience this state, you cannot say what it is. No words And that's why it's so beautiful that the Tantras use this uh cosmic symbolism. So, it's not uh physiology. It is it is symbolism In transcendence, I can I mean Literally visualize going beyond the physical body, but how do you go beyond the cosmic body?

Well, it's simultaneous because you experience the cosmos in the body. So, you cannot um uh when the cosmos is not in your hands, but your body. I mean, the the moment you transcend your body, bodily bodily limitations, that it is already And cosmos being symbolic language needs a symbolic understanding. So, if we try to to rationalize it or to um dissolve it into uh the final form Then let me the planet is so small. Symbolic language needs a symbolic understanding. So, if we try to to rationalize it, or to to um observe it in the in the final form, then let me the planet is so small. Symbolic language needs a symbolic understanding. So, if we try to to rationalize it, or to um dissolve it into the the final form, then let me the planet is so small. Oh, I have one here, especially for. Yeah, what is this? I have one here, especially for. Yeah, what is this? I have one here, especially for. So then, that is far. So, that is far. So, that is far. 

*Sushiumna*: one of the principal rays of the sun; the particular artery of the human body situated lying between *Iḍā* and *Piṅgalā*. That's what we already read. 

> *Yaḥ samālambyam* is holding onto that tender state which was previously experienced as consciousness placed in the state of vehement anger, etc. *Samālambyam* also implies having decided that it is a goal worth achieving. He studies stands in implies that, laying to rest all thought constructs, he resorts to a state of the absence of thought constructs, particularly firmly. 

*Sūrya* and *Chandra*. This *Śukla* and *Abāhnā* meeting in the state of *Prithā*. So, here the question was whether do you start from *mūlādhāra* or from the heart? Both experiences are described, but here is this from heart. 

> And being merged together in the channel *Sushiumna*, which is otherwise called *Brahma Nadi*, journeying to be the upper (that is the *Udāna* root) get dissolved in the great ether of consciousness, abandoning the sphere of the body: the state of *a-Para Brahman* uh *Brahman*, and the They leave the really one of the great spiritual traditions. And one should not water it down to some psychic, you know, uh just emotional, uh not emotional in that sense of actually the But um to identify certain sensations with that great power of consciousness. And that great power of consciousness, as he says here, is moving in the *mahayoman*, in the great ether of consciousness beyond the *brahmāṇḍa*, beyond the body.

So, now I left out the *bhūta sūkṣma* uh the maybe if we want, we can do it in the next. But I think uh we have concluded the first section of the text, and um so either we make a break tomorrow, which would be good, maybe also to get some air, and and then we continue with the second section, the afternoon. It depends a bit on the weather. Yeah? 

Can we listen to the KG, would you? Huh? Can we listen to that uh what we are supposed to listen in the morning? KG and Well, I don't know, I think we are tired now. 

You see, um I I just tell you the best, according to me, but Alexandra can correct me, the best description, and brief description, of these four groups of *śaktis* is in this *Spanda Sandoha*, and which is translated by Mark. And I leave the book here, and it is marked. And then, one can read it um No, *Spanda Sandoha*. It it it's a very good, brief uh description of these groups of *śaktis*. Otherwise, one has to go into great detail and so on and so forth. He's off.
