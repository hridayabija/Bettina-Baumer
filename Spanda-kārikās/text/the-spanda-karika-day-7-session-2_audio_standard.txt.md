## Spanda Kārikās - Continued Exploration

**Afternoon is always a little bit lower pressure from the cosmic and the physical, so we'll try to concentrate.** So, we have completed the second *niśīandā*, the second flow. And we have reached such a high peak that now we can only come down, you know, from *jīvanmukti* where to go? And so coming down means coming down to the yogic powers and the *vibhūti*. It is always a descent. 

And this is a bit uh most probably inspired by the Yoga Sutras. There also, the third, I think the third chapter, is *vibhūti pāda* uh and the extraordinary powers.

Now, when you speak of *jīvanmukti*, the only thing which really helps is if you have known *jīvanmukti*. If you know what the Gita says in the second *adhyāya*: "Who is the *sthitaprajña*?", "Who is that who is established?" And then it describes how does it… I don't know, ask him how does he move, how does he talk, how does he live, how does he… and so on. So, this is only if you have experienced, then only you can um identify what what is that state.

Now, if he comes down uh from this supreme state of *jīvanmukti* to the yogic powers… It concerns… The yogic powers concern the *prabuddha* who is not yet fully established. And um well they also concern the *suprabuddha* because they occur spontaneously to the *jīvanmukta* or the *suprabuddha*. These powers come spontaneously. There's nothing to do, any effort or um make any special *mantra* or anything, to experience those powers. But the higher advanced the yogi or the *jīvanmukta* is, the less importance he gives to *vibhūtis* or the less does he show them. See, the problem with those who are *prabuddha* but not *suprabuddha* is that once these powers come, then they want to show them, and then they want to become famous, and they want to have so many disciples and this that. And that's a great pitfall. 

But it seems a kind of law of nature that these powers do exist and they do come. They come either spontaneously or by some exercise, some rituals, or some *mantras*, etc. 

Now, Śrī Aurobindo gives a summary of this whole section, which we don't need to read. But just on the end of the beginning, but again, he again he says that the first section was devoted to *nimilana samādhi* and the second to *unmilana*, and… Yeah, this is just the only the introductory sentence to his summary of the third section, page 127 in the book.

> Thus by the…

Which verse? Verse 75. 75. What they call it? Um. One… 130, 131, yeah. 

Yeah. Do you mean in the Spanda Kārikā, we are on page 130. 

Yeah, I wanted this chapter 131. Yeah. 

Also, this verse does not speak on dream. It speaks on the intercessor state in between. Um but one can assume that if one enters into dream from such a state of awareness, then the dream would be also very transparent. The- the point of that state is the transparency of pure consciousness between waking and sleep, but it does not explicitly speak of dream.

So, 55, um speaks of mastery over one's dreams.

> "If the energy of breath is meditated- meditated upon its gross and feeble, at *prāṇaśānta*, (and entering the heart), at the time of sleeping, then one will attain mastery over one's dreams."

And uh there are two versions, uh *suptasvātantriyam*, or *muktasvātantriyam*, but some issue has preferred *suptasvātantriyam*. Independence over one's dreams. So that is really the prerogative of the advanced yogi.

Now, which *prāṇaśānta* is meant here? It is most probably the *Brahmaraṇḍhra*. Entering in the heart, meditating at the place of *prāṇaśānta* and entering into the heart. Means meditating on the heart and then um that state, that very subtle state will come in which one has independence over dreams. So one is not the victim of nightmares, etc. That's at least a negative side of it. 

The author of this verse says, "This is *adhama upāya*." Now, *adhama upāya* is the inferior means. 

*Adhama upāya* is… is the lower. Yeah, the lower means. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Which means, yogis also have lower means and superior?

No, of course! I mean, yogis of every level, but um uh for the yogis of the uh awakened type, you know, these- they don't have to aspire uh for the- the- they- they will get these revelations spontaneously. But here's the question of praying, praying also, praying for uh uh who never- no, no, who never desists from his selfless prayer, means a yogi who prays for a good dream.

But uh Tsaṃkara, in his introduction, he says that uh the power of the *suprabuddha*, to overcome the ordinary state of dream and deep sleep. So it can be applied to the different yogis depending on their uh condition.

Now, we come to verse three. Um the little introductory sentences is:

> *yati punaḥ evaṃ sāvadhānau na bhavati tadā na asya yoginaḥ, yogitā iti arthaḥ.*

The author says, "If a person is not thus concentrated, then he is not fit to be a yogi." I wouldn't say concentrated. *Sāvadhāna*, if he is not attentive, if he- he is not aware. And we had this again and again, *sāvadhāna*. Again and again, it reminds us of that Vijñānabhairava, *yoginaḥ tu viśeṣato’sti sambandhe sāvadhānatāḥ*. They are aware of the connection. They are aware of- of the relation. They are aware of the unity. So that awareness is um what has to be always there, even of the advanced- for the advanced yogi. *Sāvadhāna*, who has been in the Ramlila? You must have- uh- you remember when this- the *sūtradhāra* who- who um you know, there's no mic in the Ramlila, in Ramnagar, Benares. And then, this *sūtradhāra*, he gets up and there are thousands of people, and he just with his hand he says, "Chup raho! *Sāvadhān*!" And thousands of people are totally silent. It's so impressive because he had no uh no mic or nothing. And there's thousands of people and and they only speak with their own natural voice. They don't- you have this thing. Uh and this *sāvadhāna*, now I do remember that, because it's so impressive, you know, how he uh uh he attentive he is. It's beautiful, no?

*Anya- anyathā tu svātantrasyāt sṛṣṭiḥ svataḥ tamātmakat- katvatā satataṃ laukika-sevā-jāgat-svapna-vad- vad-tvayi.* Otherwise, the creative power of the divine, Creative power, he translate *svataḥtāḥ*. According to its characteristics, is free in manifesting always all kinds of things to the yogi, both in waking and dream states, as in the case of the common people of the world.

Yeah, *sṛṣṭiḥ svataḥtāḥ*, the- the free creative power, according to her own nature, *tamātmakatvatāḥ*. And she manifests in both states, waking and dreaming. So, the yogi as well as uh as to the ordinary people. So, what is expressed here is also the danger of uh uh being pulled down, if one is not in that state of awareness. And that being pulled down happens very easily in uh dream or in uh in sleep, because if one is not advanced then we have no control and then uh your- you are overwhelmed by uh what is happening in- in dream. So, that warning is there, but actually, um it would require some more detailed uh explanation.

He says in the introduction to his um character… A very gif- very ordi- ordinary example: how you observe something which first you perceive it vaguely and then you look more closely and then you perceive it more precisely. The same thing applies also to uh pain. 

> *Yathā hi artho asphuṭo dṛṣṭaḥ sāvadhāne picetasi bhūyaḥ sphuṭataḥ bhāti svabaloddyogabhāvītaḥ tathā yatparāmṛto ’nena yathayathāsthitam tattathā balam ākramya na cirāt saṁpravṛttate.* The… just as a thing which in spite of all the attentiveness of the mind is perceived indistinctly at first, appears more distinctly later when observed with the strenuous exercise of one's power. 

It's an ordinary observation. So, when the *yogī* resorts to the power of *spanda*, then whatever thing actually exists in whichever form, in whichever…

So we'll just take one more verse. I don't want to take uh too much text. Maybe this afternoon they will not do more than… I think seven verses are enough. The third, a section, has 19 verses, so we will be able to complete…

> *anena atiṣṭhite dehe yathā sarvajñatā ādaya tathā svātmani atiṣṭhanāt sarvathā aivam abhiṣyāti.*

So now they will uhm yogi power is omniscience. *sarvajñatā* Means this all-knowing ability etcetera in respect of the body occurs when it is pervaded by that… Again *anena spanda* principle of the *buddhi* (in bracket). Even so, when the yogi is established in his essential self, he will have omniscience etcetera everywhere.

*anena atiṣṭhite dehi yathā sarvajñatatā ādaya.* So omniscience etcetera, that means uh all the powers of omniscience, om… only um all-pervasion, *vyāpakatvā*, etcetera. So the condition is um given very briefly. *anena atiṣṭhite dehi.* If if um the body is… the power which is guiding the body depends on that, means on that *spanda*, then he has access to omniscience. And that *spanda* we have uh encountered it in the cases of, you know, uh *atikrūtopabṛṁhiṣṭo vā* in in states of intensity. That's where it is experienced and this state of intensity they have to be preserved by awareness, *avadhāna*. They have to be constantly aware. He says you should not become loose, the the awareness *na śithila śithilībhāvati* should not become loose. So losing that intensity, losing that state of awareness, that would be the opposite. But maintaining that or being presided over by this power and *spanda* is then often called this *bala*, by the power. Then he has access to omniscience.

*svātmani atiṣṭhanāt.* We had uh used that expression: "being the master in your own house", "being the established in your own self". Then he gets different um powers, omniscience…

> "When the body is pervaded by these, that is by this *spanda* principle which is one's own essential self." *svasvabhāvātmā spandaśaktinā atiṣṭhite yat te dehe…* "When is pervaded, then as experiences of things suited to that state, such as states of all-knowing ability, all doership, manifest themselves to the embodied being."

> "So if the yogi gets established in his imperishable self, that is the spiritual consciousness recognized as such, if he is steadily absorbed in that state either by destroying his sins or withdrawing himself etcetera, or *satpratyayas* that we have seen that before. Or by the device of the expansion of all embracing consciousness, *vikāśa*, then he ac- acquires omniscience and omnipotence, powers appropriate to Shiva everywhere."

So these uh the two main powers, uh, *sarvajñatā* and *sarvakartṛtā*. So the whole uh discussion on what means omniscience in relation to… we have this text on the *sarvajñatā* of the Buddha um with a lot of discussion and what does it mean in relation to the enlightened uh yogi. But he doesn't go into this.

And maybe one more verse because I- I like this… Not, it's not so difficult, this. 

> *jñāna-vilunţhikā dehe tasya tasyāśca ajñā ajñānataḥ sthitiḥ tat-unmeṣa-viluptaṁ cet kutas tasya ajñā hetukāt.* 

Just as a plunderer carries away the valuables of the house, even so depression saps away the vitality of the body. Now, this is the opposite. *jñāna-vilunţhikā* Now, *jñāni*… *jñāni* is uh he translates it as depression, but it's a kind of uh lassitude. You know, if the only condition to- to stick to that power of *spanda* was the constant awareness, state of intense awareness. Now, if you… If that awareness slackens and you become lazy, you become um… and that laziness uh translates into um negative um state. So *jñāni*, it's not wrong also to translate this depression. 

"This depression proceeds from ignorance. If that ignorance disappears by omniscience, how can that depression last in the absence of its cause?" *unmeṣa-vilupta* Now, the loss of awareness… *unmeṣa* also means awakening. Also means uh awareness uh awakening. So this happens by- by the loss of awareness. And if- if that ignorance disappears by- by *unmeṣa*, how can that depression last in the absence of its cause? *ajñānataḥ.* Yeah, out of ignorance. But ignorance means um a lack of awareness.

So again and again we come to the same point that um the main experience of *spanda* is an experience of intensity of awareness. And if that intensity slackens or is lost then everything is lost. It's like- like the thieves break into your house, and that house is your own mind and um and they take away all the treasures which you have already accumulated, the spiritual treasures. As at the end he says this uh uh also the verse which we recite, the second, second one. *jñāna-dhanam*, the treasure of knowledge. This treasure will be stolen by your own weakness, by your own uh slackness of… by your own lack of awareness. So this is a very important warning. Again, like before, we had the- the thieves uh on the way stealing, and these thieves were the *guṇas*, and here the thief uh is the own uh lack of um intense awareness.

So is- is that like a warning to the uh uh aspirant to continuously working on himself? They don't… Once they get some of these boons or realizations, it doesn't just keep flowing by itself. You have to keep working on it. 

Yes, yes, yes, yes. So until you are *supra buddha*, until you are *jīvanmukta*, one has to be always uh aware. Um guarding one's house from uh losing that treasure which you have already uh received. 

So what's the practical method? But this is the whole uh… Everything is- is based on awareness. To be- to stay with that experience and not to let it go, not to let it um… Once you have received it, then you be aware and be intensely aware of that treasure and to maintain it, to retain it. And uh that's why the basic- basic practice is practice of awareness. Which of course, meditation etcetera is all um part of increasing that awareness and increasing that uh state of consciousness.

So, it ends with that uh warning and um yeah, he says very nicely that what means *jñāni*. *jñāni* uh well which you translated as depression, means the disappearance of the essential delight. *Tāttvika harṣasya kṣaya.* The basic uh essential joy. If that is lost, then a kind of depression will… And we find, you know, many spiritual people, many people who are on the spiritual path, at some point, you know, they sink into a kind of uh depression. It's called, I think, "Oh, I'm not making an advancement. I am not any…" uh so it's a very dangerous um uh thing to be on the spiritual path and then entering in that state of um disillusionment uh depression. That's- That's very uh dangerous thing. That's why again and again is said that continuously being, continuously in that state of awareness.

Okay. I think we stop here for today, uh because there are many personal talks are still pending um tomorrow. Uh, and this verse, and this verse in the beginning, this author says that he will have this experience also through his grace. Yeah. This *etad-prasādena* *etad-prasādena* Not this *etad*, he- he says it is *spanda* by grace of that um you will have… I mean the- the this uh  Spiritual powers they have of course an aspect, an aspect of grace. They are an expression of grace, either *prasāda* or p- P…
