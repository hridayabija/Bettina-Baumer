May be yeah.

Um um, I think sometime... I'm sorry, I need a book. So, I also welcome you. Most of you are already friends and regular attendance, and the new ones will become friends. So, um I'm very happy that we are such a rich group. And, after a little general introduction, I will ask you to introduce yourselves because we are not so many and we should know each other. 

Now, uh the what um Maliti has said about this place... I I love the spirit of this Deer Park. And uh, I have experienced it last year. And I I must say, it is really something which we should strive for because also, it's a Buddhist place, but uh it says that it is there for the study of classical Indian and Western traditions. And uh, precisely Kashmir Shaivism is one of these great wisdom traditions, and it has been included, and I'm sure it will be also in future included in the programs of Deer Park. Now, the spirit of Deer Park is based on a spirit of openness and dialogue between the different traditions and the combination of study and practice. 

So, these are the things which uh I find ideal because uh, in the university you only study the texts or the philosophy, and in the other retreat centers you only meditate. But here, to combine the two, that was always my method and uh and, it's the traditional method because all the traditional teachings have been passed on with text study and practice. So, this uh we are continuing with the same method. And um...

This dialogue and mutual learning of the different traditions... You know, we have often stressed that these traditions like Buddhism and uh different schools of Hindu philosophy, they were uh fighting with each other, and uh there's a lot of um controversy, and fast track, and so on. But actually... And we just recently had a seminar in Shimla of a very academic nature. If you study these traditions, they were mutually enriching each other. And by dialoguing and by learning from each other or sharpening their tools uh by exchanging and learning, so that it was not the kind of competition or fighting as we have it today among fundamentalist um trends in the uh different religions, but it was a process of mutual enrichment. 

And this is very much true of Kashmir Shaivism and Buddhism. Because uh, Abhinavagupta, the great uh greatest exponent of Kashmir Shaivism, he learned from a Jaina and Buddhist masters, and he quotes Dharmakīrti with the greatest reverence. And he has taken over many things from Buddhist logic and then adapted it to his own system. So, it was a process of uh mutual enrichment. And what is also fascinating is that um it was not a one-sided on-sided one-sided traffic, because what the uh especially the Tibetan Buddhists have taken over from uh Kashmir Shaivism is the other tantric traditions. 

And we know also, by the latest scholarship, that many of the Shaiva Tantras or Āgamas were translated into Tibetan, and were incorporated into the Tibetan canon and the practical uh aspects in the rituals, and even the iconography and and so so many aspects of Shaiva Tantras were accepted and incorporated into the uh Tibetan traditions, especially by Tsongkhapa. So, this uh process should be should continue here in in this wonderful place. And um...

Not only that mutual enrichment um but also the fact that one tradition does not consider itself absolute. So... And this has created the greatest problems in among tensions between religions and philosophies. 

And here we have a a great example in Kashmir Shaivism, how they have transcended the differences. And um I tell you just one example that is uh there are different... You know, the those who know uh Hindi or Sanskrit, because *ācāra... Ācāra* means not only doctrine, means practice. So, the or the The way of life. So, the The is a degree or a hierarchy of *ācāras*, which starts very realistically from *lokācāra*. *Lokācāra* means the worldly activity, which uh everybody accepts in the society and so on. That then, the next step in the Hindu tradition is *vedācāra*. So, *vedācāra* means you accept the Vedic prescriptions, and then the caste system, and all the *Dharmaśāstra* um uh injunctions, how to behave in the world and according to *dharma*, family um rules for family life, rituals, et cetera. 

Then, the next step is *śaivācāra*. The *śaivācāra* is the practice of Shaivism as uh we can say, as a religion. But um of course, in the Advaita Shaiva tradition, it is already oriented towards its own transcendence. *Śaivācāra* can be also considered simply Shaivism, what we call Shaivism. But beyond *śaivācāra* is *advaitācāra*. And if *śaivācāra* has to lead to *advaitācāra*, it means that the practice of non-duality... Non-duality is not just a theorem or a philosophical doctrine, but it is a way of practice. So, how do you practice *advaita*? It's very clearly explained in the uh texts that practicing *advaita* means breaking the social conventions. Which means, caste system, gender difference, and all that. So, *advaitācāra* means uh a kind of *advaita* in practice. In in in practical life, and between uh human beings, and so on. 

But this is not the end. The last stage is *nirācāra*. *Nirācāra* means beyond any prescription or any rules or any um anything which binds you in in a religious uh universe, you know? Even *advaita* can become a bondage or or kind of doctrine to which you are sticking. But *nirācāra*, it goes uh beyond even *advaitācāra*. And we have this beautiful... in the... That Utpaladeva was the greatest philosopher of um *pratyabhijñā*, of the recognition. He has a beautiful verse to this effect, and he says... But, the translation may be not so poetic uh... He speaks of different tantric traditions. We know that *dakṣiṇācāra* means the right-winged tantric, and the *vāmacāra*, the left-winged tantric, and so on. 

"So may you be glorified, O Śārva, who are the essence of the right-handed path, who are the essence of the left-handed path, who [are] every tradition and no tradition at all: *Nirācāraya te namaḥ*." 

So, praise be to you who have no binding to any tradition. This is something you know, to to have the courage to go beyond any uh any fixed uh prescribed rules and regulations, which we associate with... So, he is the one who is behind every tradition, *sarvācāra*, and he is *nirācāra*. He's also beyond any tradition. So, this is uh the spirit of this tradition is so vast and so universal. 

Um uh that's what I find here in this place also, that um to go beyond um any fixed um religious or spiritual traditions. 

And uh, regarding different schools of philosophy, those who have done the *pratyabhijñā* retreat in Varanasi in December, they may remember remember that there is a *sūtra* which says that all the different schools of philosophy or religion, they are like roles played by the divine actor. So, the divine actor, the absolute, he takes on different roles. And these roles, they may be Shaiva, or they may be materialist, or they may be uh anything, maybe Buddhists, maybe *Sāṅkhya*, or Yoga. Any tradition! But, they are roles played by played by the same absolute. So, it again, it's not that uh you know uh clash, but the the that universality.

But of course, there is a double meaning, like in most of the things in Kashmir Shaivism. *Bhūmikā* means the role, role played by the actor. But, *bhūmikā* also means stages. So, the stages of the spiritual life are also called *bhūmikā*. So, what [is] that divine... That absolute. He not only assumes different roles as different uh philosophical systems, but he is also the one who assumes every stage of spiritual life. And it's so consoling! Such a wonderful idea, because we are going through different stages! You know, we may think that, "Oh, we are stuck in some uh level, and we are not making any advance uh not advancing," and so on. But, he is there at every *bhūmikā*, at every level! So, it's again this universal idea that every stage of spiritual life or development is also his aspect. 

So, this is this *bhūmikā*. *Bhūmikā* means also of course, levels of consciousness. And that, in Buddhism, you have also the *daśabhūmikā*, and so on. And it's so interesting, you know, when you study the Hindu temple, there are *daśabhūmikā*. There are ten levels uh ten stages or stories, and the symbolism of the whole temple is to reach that pinnacle where the whole ascent ends and you enter into supreme *ākāśa*. So, it's again, the same symbolism of these ten stages or ten *bhūmikās*, maybe less or more, but in the Buddhism, we have uh ten also um until you reach that stageless stage, that *nirācāra*, or... Can you close that window? It's... I'm... That's too much. No. No, I get a draft, you know, and I'm very sorry, but I'm so still suffering from my Shimla cold. 

So, this is just by way of uh general introduction and the general attitude which is behind uh this whole uh tradition. Now um on practical um let us first look at two practical things before I request you to introduce yourselves, and then we start with the text. One thing is the program. This... Just because um one program is hanging outside the Dharma hall, one program is hanging at the office, and another one at the dining area. So, you don't have each one a program in hand, but I think it's enough to orient yourself. And, by the time we start, you will be accustomed to the rhythm. 

So, we start meditation at 6:00. And for those who are brave, they continue till 7:30. But um the normal time, I expect everybody to sit for one hour. If you have any problem with meditation, then we can talk about it or we can uh either personally or generally, what um what you require. But, I do expect you to sit for one hour. And those who cannot sit longer, I would request them to take an *āsanam* not so far from the door, because if you sit right in front and then you walk out while the others are still meditating, it will be disturbing. So, those who are sitting longer, they can be closer to the altar and the others. And you take one *āsanam* and stay with it for the whole week. It's better to not to go on changing. It create[s] some kind of restlessness, you know? "Oh, this fellow is now sitting on my seat! Why should I now search for another one?" So, you choose one place today, and then you stick to it. 

7:30 is breakfast, and the mealtimes timings are very early here. The usual Indian timings timings are very late. But, you'll get used to it. Then, they have sufficient time for for breakfast or to go back to your room, if you have to take bath, or whatever. 9:00 to 10:30 is teaching. Then, there is a tea break. And since the lunch is already at 12:00, we have another meditation from 11:00 to 12:00, because my ideal um number of hours which we should reach possibly is four hours meditation daily. 

So, those who are sitting only one hour, instead of one and a half, of course they will get only three hours. But um, it depends on your capacity and your desire and your um... So, one shouldn't force oneself if one is not um able to sit through. So, 12:00 is lunch. Then, uh again, the sufficient space before the next teaching. Next teaching is from 3:00 to 4:30. Then, again tea break. And then, we have put here "meditative walk." Now, the meaning is that we are sitting the whole day. So, we should have some movement, since in our tradition, we don't have walking meditation like in uh Zen. Um and if it's not just raining heavily, we can do it either collectively or individually. But um, there are very nice walks around here, and um last year we had Linda to guide us, but I'm sure we'll find somebody to guide us. I know some ways also, but I'm still a bit weak to walk too much. And I don't know whether I got... You can find somebody to help us. One of the boys, maybe. Um, if you want to do it together. 

And that time, in the afternoon, is also a chance to talk. So, while walking, we can also talk. Because we have... Again, we are making a resolve. Every time, we make a resolve and we break it! Uh to keep silence from dinner till lunch. So, this time I will be more strict, and maybe some others will also play uh uh support me in being strict. Because it's so easy, you know? We are all wonderful people, and we are so much interested to know each other and to exchange our experience, and so on. But, this is not only a seminar, it's a retreat. So, retreat means that we want to gain something for ourselves! And uh, it's not only for ourselves, but the respect for the other to be in that atmosphere of silence. See, speaking or breaking silence is very easy, very quick. And the moment you break silence, you lose that energy, which is uh concentrated uh in the silence. So, I would really request you this time to try to keep it. And to whatever you feel like talking, keep it for the afternoon. And either you can sit somewhere, you can go for a walk, or uh... So, that is... We have sufficient time. Well, maybe not so much time, but still... You see, the 4:30 is tea break. 4:45 to 6:00 is written "meditative walk." So, it depends on us, I mean um how quickly we drink our tea or how far we want to walk, and we can be a little flexible in that. But in any case, uh after lunch um we can break the silence. 

Now, we can uh instead of walking, can we do yoga? 

Yes, of course. Of course, I mean, it's just to get some movement. So, those who are yogis, like last year we had Samuel, he was spending hours in doing *āsanās* here. Perfect *āsanās* uh... So, you are most welcome, those who want to do yoga.

Yeah, and excuse me... And I thought, let's decide the place also. Should we do it here itself for yoga? For exercise, or for yoga?

Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. You have those mats? You can remove something or add something. It's quite flexible. Great yogi. Another one! We have some great yogis here, so I know that. Um but, on the other hand, to walk in nature is also very beautiful here. 

Now, since we have nine days um I mean, this is a little, as we say, a little sweat which we are keeping up for also working very hard with the text. Um one day, I would propose to go out, if the weather permits, um to go really out for the whole day! We take some picnic or as we did on Billing, you know? And so that we experience the nature here around also. Because, when [we] are walk[ing], it is just going and coming back. But um if we go on the mountain... One has to organize it, but it would give us a little break, and also satisfy us, you know, that we have been in this wonderful uh landscape, that we have experienced that. 

So, Billing is that one mountain where I know where one can go, but maybe other... We'd get some advice from the locals. 

Okay, then evening again after dinner, dinner 6:00. 6:00 and 7:30 to 8:30 or 9:00 is the night meditation. So, on the program is written, "The last hour uh half-hour meditation session is optional." So, that's up to yourself. Uh any questions regarding the program? Maybe, we have followed the same [one] what we did last year, so it's a little bit of uh any other suggestion?

Okay, then the second practical point are the books. 

Yes uh you know we don't uh use any bell to say, "This is time," or... Really, for a what we do... If if I'm given a bell or somebody else is given a bell, we can ring the bell, so that... We've used one just now. Uh, the the the bell outside the temple. 

Yeah, I've used it at 2:50 to basically say it's the time to...

Yeah, yeah. If somebody can be in charge of uh doing that, the temple one.

Yeah. Who offers himself? Okay. Thank you! You're our timekeeper. So, 15 minutes uh 10 minutes and uh long solo uh of the...

But as I said, the number of uh three times, seven... Three. Yeah, a bell would be helpful here because people don't always look at their watch or... 

Yeah. 

So now, regarding books: who has the basic text, *Spandakārikā*? How many have it? How many uh... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 

Now, uh Deepti Singh has been kind enough to bring five copies of *Spandakārikā* from Delhi, which uh those who want to have... Only four available, because one is her own. So, first come, first served. Four copies available now! 

Yes. And you tell them how much they have to pay, Kavita?

And 12:00? No, I would suggest... I'm sorry um to... That one copy should be bought by the Dheeraj Bach Institute for their library, which then can be borrowed by any one of you. Because, they don't have it, and they should uh instead of ordering it again, you know, during this course, they can... You can use it. But, we will ask them to um purchase one for the library. How much is [it] worth, one copy?

225.

Huh? 225?

225. It's really not costly. 

So, you take one of your own, otherwise it will be gone. So, I think one for Dheeraj Bach, and then you can borrow it from them, somebody.

So, the... Hello? Are there more people than the copies? And those who don't have um, you please share it with your neighbors. Because, copying the whole book, it's not possible. 

Actually, you don't have... Are you...? You have to share. Actually share, I ask him.

Yeah, yeah, I mean the the trouble of sharing is that the print is so small. And uh... 

Sharing is... That we have to have a copy in the hand while we are in... Excuse me. We have the copy in the hand while we are in the discourse. 

Well, I mean uh if you are very good listener, then you don't need a copy. See what happened in the ancient times? Uh, there is a beautiful story among the folk tales from India by A.K. Ramanujan. The title is *What Happens When You Really Listen*, and it's a a miracle which happens. So, most people, see, it goes here and goes out the other side. So, if you have a book at least uh... But uh um to listen is a great capacity. 

So, I have another... My keys are on... Excuse me.

You need the mic?

Oh, no. I think, put it on because it doesn't also work.

Now, Isabelle uh gets um the French for the time being. French. And is it for sale or is it um um from...? 

Yeah, we took copies. Generally bought uh... 

So, these books uh which are other texts of Kashmir Śaivism, they will be kept here for consultation or for reference. But please, don't take them out of this room! Because, occasionally, we may need... You know, the first workshop on Kashmir Śaivism we had here, it was in the context of the *parātrīśikāvivarana*... So, and the text was *Parātrīśikāloka*, *vivṛti*. So, the text by Abhinavagupta on the Supreme Court is *parā*... So, see, we are not paragliders, we are *parā* gliders. We are gliding in this sky of consciousness, not in this external sky! So, that's what we are trying to do. 

So, maybe uh... Thank you very much for your personal uh statements. And um maybe I should say two words uh about myself. 

Not what everybody knows, but no. No, really. No. Because um... You can come uh near. You can even bring your chair near, near us. 

Yes. See, when it gets to text teaching, and then you can record that everywhere also. You come closer, yeah. Your your ears are better than mine, I think.

No, I have to ask separate, according to...

Two things everybody knows about me, I don't need to uh repeat. But uh uh because, yesterday in the evening meditation, I mentioned that my first guru passed away two days ago. So, maybe I should say something uh because um we are going... The very first *śloka* we are learning is to praise the guru. So, what does it mean?

Abhinavagupta says also in the *Tantrāloka* and in the *Tantrasāra* that one can have several gurus, depending on one's spiritual progress. And uh but, one should never leave behind a perfect guru, perfect master. But one should proceed to the more perfect one. So, in that sense, I want to pay my respect to my first guru or teacher, that is Raymond Panikkar, who passed away on 26th, 26th, the Wednesday before yesterday. And yesterday evening, we heard His Holiness reciting the um *Mahā-mṛtyuñjaya-mantra* to celebrate his passing to the uh *Nirvāṇa*. 

Now, I I mean, I have three gurus, and Panikkar was the first to put me on the spiritual path. So, I had some experiences, everybody has experiences, and you don't know what to do with it and how to proceed, and how to find the spiritual path, you know? You don't even know what is a spiritual path, especially in the West. At least in India, you have many more chances. And when I met Panikkar for the first time, he immediately understood what I was searching, and so he could help me in that... Those first steps, you know, to get into the spiritual path. And I can never forget my indebtedness to him. And of course, he was not only a a guide in that sense, but he was a great philosopher and um a great pioneer in this meeting between cultures and religions. So, he has played a very important role even in UNESCO, you know, introducing the whole question of religion into the meeting of cultures. In UNESCO, there was no place for religion! Can you imagine? How can you have culture without religion? And uh he was very decisive uh in uh this intercultural and interreligious meeting, and with a very deep insights. And I worked with him for more than 25 years, and we brought out together one uh anthology of the Vedas, *The Vedic Experience*, and so on. So, he was in Banaras, and I was working with him in Banaras. And I am ever grateful to him. 

But, the real greatness I must say, if a teacher or a guru accepts that the disciple moves on to a higher level, it's not easy. And that I must say, that was his greatness. Because, when I became a disciple of Swami Lakshman Joo, and I'm afraid it was not so easy for him, but then I sent him the book, which is here, on Swami Lakshman Joo, and then I... He acknowledged that he was great, and he also acknowledged that I had to move on. So, this was his greatness, and it's the greatest renunciation for a guru to renounce a disciple who goes further. And uh so, I must say this was really um a great... His generosity, and his openness, and um not holding on, you know? Most gurus, they hold on to their disciples, and they don't want you to move further, to go beyond where you have reached in their presence. But, if you find a perfect guru, then no... Nobody, nothing in the world can stop you. 

And so, my second guru, I didn't mention that, is Swami Abhishiktānanda, who passed away already in 1973. But um...

So, my gratitude, my acknowledgement to Panikkar is not only to his philosophical greatness, his uh great mind and uh everything, but this generosity to allow me to go beyond what he has shown me, and to become a disciple of Swami Lakshman Joo. And even he told me very sincerely that, "You have found a treasure." So, the treasure of Kashmir Shaivism. So, he acknowledged it. And that is real greatness. Real greatness.

So, that's my uh tribute to Panikkar. 

And uh the second thing which I want to explain, because you will find uh another name added to my name, Śāradā, and and I am getting Indian citizenship. And then, there was a column, you know, "Do you have an Indian name?" So then, I asked Pappadevi, who is the disciple of Swami Lakshman Joo, who is still surviving. Uh I said, "I cannot give myself a name. You, please think about it and ask Swamiji." And then, she gave me that. So otherwise, I was not uh you know, taking any initiative in that sense, but now I feel it is right. And Pappadevi, she is now 85, but she is mentally completely fresh. I mean, she... You call her, and she'll immediately quote from the *Tantrāloka*, from uh you know, she knows all the texts by heart, and uh tremendous uh mental and uh spiritual freshness. So, we just pray that she will be with us for many more years, but at this age, you can never know. 

So, this was just the personal uh confession which I wanted to add so that you understand this uh context. 

And what is the name Pappadevi...? 

Śāradā. 

Śāradā? She gave me Śāradā?

Yeah. 

So now, uh we come to the text. 

Of course, those who have identity with *Vijñāna Bhairava*... *Vijñāna Bhairava* is of course a text which is extremely practical. Although, I must say, none of the texts of Kashmir Shaivism is easy! Don't expect any text to be easy! I mean, you can maybe read *Tantra Sāra*, or well, *Yogasūtra*... I go through. But, there are certain texts which are relatively easy to read, and you understand them. But, Kashmir Shaiva texts are not easy, but Pappadevi said very nicely. She said, "The texts are not difficult, they are subtle." So, it requires a subtle mind to understand them. And subtle means, what I always say, that unless you have somewhere in your life some spiritual experience, you cannot catch what is meant here. So, some kind of spiritual experience is absolutely necessary to understand this text. And if you have it or you had it, you will recognize yourself, you will recognize your own experience in the text. That's why the texts are a kind of mirror in which we can uh see our own reflection. And uh as uh Vedanta says so beautifully, uh we don't have to pretend, we can be what we are. And this is uh exact expression in Sanskrit, *yadṛśī yāvatī vā ahaṃ tathā*. 

So, the *Vijñāna Bhairava* is, of course, very famous because of its practicality. But even if you remember, it's not an easy text. And um... Of course, we jump to... You know that if [you are] sneezing, you get illumination. Even by sneezing, and so on. But, that comes, first of all, at the very end! And you have to go through a lot of experiences to reach that stage of consciousness where everything and anything becomes a a cause of uh enlightenment. Uh so, it's not evident, you know, that immediately you will uh enter into that state of consciousness.

Now um just locating... Now before locating this *Spanda Kārikā* in the tradition, I would like uh to follow our own tradition. And that is to to start with the recitation of a *maṅgala-śloka*. And I'm very sorry, I am being very sick, so my voice is very poor. And I hope those who have learnt the *ślokas*, they will be strong support because last year, we had Raji uh with her strong voice, and this year, I am uh relying on all of you to to learn to join in. Now, in this uh particular *śloka* for recitation, it's the last one. So, we have the Devanāgarī and we have the transliteration and the translation. 

So first, I have to justify that I am starting our text from the end! And maybe some of you are tempted when you get a book in hand that you start from the end, you know uh reading from the end. I am sometimes tempted. But here, I have a very specific reason. Because, in the beginning of any teaching, you have to pay respect to the guru. And in some uh Kashmir Shaiva texts, this *maṅgala*, or um homage offered to the guru comes in the beginning, and others, it comes at the end. So, even Abhinavagupta, at the very end of his great works, he gives a long list of all his teachers, and his... Even his parents, his relatives, his... His uh... His disciples also. Not only his teachers. Um, so that at the end...

Now, in the *Spanda Kārikā*, the *śloka* uh paying homage to the guru comes at the end. And we have to learn it in the beginning because that is how we are going to start every session, either with this or with the very first verse of the text uh to which we are coming tomorrow, because today, it will be um too much.

So, let us uh... Who has learnt this? 

Yeah. And *Āgama-saṁśaya-bhūti*, yes. Did we...?

So, I please forgive my very poor voice. 

Can you see this on the top? Is it on? On the top?

Yeah, yeah. This is on.

Yes, one minute. 

Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. It was not very correct, but let's try it again. 

Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.

Once again: *Āgama-saṁśaya-bhūti*... *Āgama-saṁśaya-bhūti*... *Āgama-saṁśaya-bhūti sam-utpannatāriṇīm*... *sam-utpannatāriṇīm*... *sam-utpannatāriṇīm vande vicitra-padāṃ*... *vande vicitra-padāṃ*... *vande vicitra-padāṃ cittāntaṃ guru-vāṇīm*.

One more of this. Now, the simple translation is: 

"I pay my homage to that wonderful speech of my guru, which is like a boat for crossing the fathomless ocean of doubt and is full of words which yield wonderful meaning." 

Now of course um it begins with the description of this bottomless ocean of doubt: *āgama-saṁśaya-bhūti*. Now, this is the world in which we live! It is that world of doubt. "Why is there so much violence? Why is there so much injustice? Why are the good people suffering? [Why do] the bad people thrive?" And so many questions! So many doubts! So many! And there is no remedy to these doubts but the word of the guru! And um so, it's not the guru who is praised here, but it is his word, *vāṇī*, *guru-vāṇī*. Because, it is the... What the guru communicates to the disciple which is the direct passing on of the power to overcome that ocean... Fathomless ocean of doubt. 

So, there is no other way! There is no other way. We had a discussion on uh in Shimla on the *guru-paramparā*. Why is it necessary that you need to be in a *guru-paramparā*, and so on? So, my answer was, "Because, this wisdom, this knowledge, has to be personal!" And personal is only when it is transferred from the guru to the disciple. And that has been how the Indian tradition has been going on since ages immemorial, that it is always a personal transmission. And when some Western scholars, they say, "Oh, Indian philosophy is all impersonal! There's nothing personal." I said, "It's just the opposite! Because, the personal transmission is the the key." Like, Swami Lakshman Joo says, "It's a master key with which you can open so many doors." The doors of understanding, and of understanding yourself. 

And uh when it says which uh the the the uh word of the guru, which is full of wonderful... Of manifold meanings. So, manifold meanings doesn't mean like you open the dictionary and you have one word, and they have so many meanings. It's not like that. But, if you receive a word of the guru, it has so many layers of meaning. And this layers of meaning, you will discover in your life experience. Like, for example, you receive uh a word from the guru, it may sound very simple, and at that moment, it touches you at a certain point of your experience. Maybe, years later, the same word will come back and will... "Oh, that is what it meant." Because, it has the power. That *guru vacati*, it has that power of of yielding so many layers of meaning, so many layers of consciousness. 

So, it's not the dictionary meanings which are meant here, but the meanings which are applied in different situations of life, different situations of our spiritual parts. Suddenly, the same word comes to you. And the real masters, they don't say much. They don't uh... It's not a question of giving a long sermon, but just one word, or one sentence, or half a sentence, and it will touch you at the depths of your heart. And maybe, some years later, you will know, "Yes, that it has some other layer of meaning, some other layer of consciousness." 

So, that is what is meant here. Otherwise, how can you cross the fathomless ocean of doubt? It's not just so many meanings. Of course, we know Sanskrit has always so many meanings, but it's not that. 

So, this uh is one of the *maṅgala ślokas* of the *Spanda Kārikā*, which we are going to repeat and hopefully, to learn a little better. Um the the tune is not the Kashmiri tune, and so that's why it has been composed by a friend of us. But, the Kashmiri tune, we will use it for the first *maṅgala*, which we are going to pick up tomorrow because it's such a deep verse that Kṣemarāja has written a whole commentary only on one verse, *Spanda Sandoha*. So, I'll explain that tomorrow.

No. But, before we um uh conclude today, I want at least to say something about the... Because, some are quite knowledgeable about Kashmir Shaivism. Others are relatively new. So, maybe I should say something about the placement and the importance of the text weare going to study. First of all, in the whole of Indian philosophy, philosophical traditions, there is only one school which deals with the dynamism of consciousness, *Spanda*. And um because it is so unique, this concept has been taken over by so many other schools, and uh and other philosophies, and especially, in uh in interpreting the Tantras, of course. Because, Kashmir Shaivism has provided a key to Tantric exegesis, not only of Shaivism, but of Shaktism, of Vaishnavism, of uh even of Buddhism. And that key is... Partly, one of the keys is the doctrine of *Spanda*, of the dynamism of consciousness. And uh so, we are going to be to go deeper into this whole um doctrine. But "doctrine" is not a nice translation, but um uh Malatichkovsky, who has done the greatest study on *Spanda*, he has called it "The Doctrine of Vibration." But, we will find some other ways of translating uh *Spanda*, that part.

Now, I do start that from the... It's always nice to start with the legend. Um in the 9th century, there was a sage, Vasugupta, living on the mountain, Mahadeva Mountain. And even now, in Kashmir, it's called Mahadeva Mountain, even by the Muslims. And uh it's a great mountain. I would still... My desire to make a pilgrimage there. And he was an ascetic, uh a *ṛṣi*, or whatever you call it, *siddha*. He was a *siddha*. And his name also means "the hidden treasure." And that, they are playing also with the meaning of this name, that of the hidden treasure.

Now, he was uh so eager to have the experience of Shiva. And one night, Shiva appeared to him in a dream, and he uh directed him. He said, "I'm going to give you uh a revelation, but you have to go to a certain rock uh at the bottom of Mahadeva Mountain." So, there's still some controversy, but I think most of the uh Kashmiris agree that it's that rock. And Swami Lakshman Joo, he... He is sitting on that rock. So, he confirmed it! Which is called Shankarāchala uh today also in Kashmir. 

So, he went. And the story is told, there is not a late uh tradition, but the story is told by Kṣemarāja, who was the direct disciple of Abhinavagupta in the 11th century. And he tells it both in his commentary on the *Shiva Sutras* as well as on the *Spanda Kārikā*. And 11th century, you see, that it must be a very authentic tradition which has come down to Kṣemarāja. And then, the next morning, Vasugupta went in search of the rock. We have these stories, you know, of the shamans, you know, in searching for a place of power. And he was attracted by that rock, and he went. And it's a huge rock, I mean! It's uh... And he touched it, and it turned around, and on the back side, were written the *Shiva Sutras*! And uh so, he memorized the *Shiva Sutras*. And and then, when he touched the rock, it turned again upside down, and they were invisible, they became invisible. 

It's a very typical story of uh revelation, you know? How uh tradition becomes revealed. It's a combination between the human and the divine. So, it's not uh uh... If Vasugupta didn't have so much of uh you know, was not such a great ascetic and uh seeker, then he wouldn't have had a dream, and he wouldn't have found the rock. But on the other hand, it's the divine initiative! So, the combination of the human and the divine is very typical in that uh legend of the discovery of the *Shiva Sutras*. 

Now, *Shiva Sutras* are so to see... The first text of Kashmir Shaivism which is not a Tantra. Because, the Tantras are common revelation, um which are accepted by all Shaivites. But, the *Shiva Sutras* are the beginning of even the philosophy, and I would say, the mysticism of Kashmir Shaivism. 

Now, the Sutras... Uh you know that in any uh Indian tradition, it may be also Buddhist, or Yoga, or anything. The first text is the Sutra. It's the briefest and uh most condensed, most difficult to understand because it needs a commentary, or it needs a living tradition to uh interpret it. And then, of course, we have so many commentaries on the *Shiva Sutras*. And but Vasugupta himself, according to some... There are other traditions which which say that it [was] his disciple, Kallaṭa. He felt that the Sutras are too terse, and it needs a little more uh expansion of the content of the Sutra. So, he wrote the *Spanda Kārikā*. 

But um Kṣemarāja is of the opinion that it is Vasugupta himself who composed the *Spanda Kārikā*. But other commentators say it was his disciple, but Kallaṭa, who was also great... Um, a great ascetic, and a great um thinker, because he is quoted again and again. And he has also composed a very brief commentary on the uh *Spanda Kārikā*.

Now, *Kārikā* means uh I mean, those who know a little Sanskrit, it means um stanza. Um but, since the *Kārikās* are also so condensed and so essential, they are often also called Sutra, *Spanda Sutra*, by some other uh even by Kṣemarāja himself. Means that the the Sutra is always the essence, the the the most condensed form of expressing any truth. And of course, there are so many uh interpretations of the meaning of Sutra. And I don't want to bother you with too much of Sanskrit, although, it's very fascinating! 

So, Sutra is a little bit like *sāra*, but even more so. It's the essence contained in a very brief statement.

So, after the *Shiva Sutra*, it is the *Spanda Kārikā* is the next important text on the uh inner tradition of Kashmir Shaivism. And significantly, it has this very central theme of *Spanda*, which we are coming again and again. With the whole week, will be spent uh trying to fathom uh what is this *Spanda*. So, the whole idea of the dynamism of consciousness, and of the divine energies... Of course, it's all connected also with the *Shakti*, with the *Shaktis*. And that, we'll see tomorrow with the first verse of the uh entire text, which is the *maṅgala śloka* uh is very much connected with uh *Shakti*. 

So, it is a very, very basic uh text in the whole tradition. And but, as some uh also, I mean, the tradition, it's also say that there are different schools which altogether... I mean, the term "Kashmir Shaivism" is a modern term. It's not traditional at all. Uh but um the different schools or traditions, which together form what we call Kashmir Shaivism, of which *Spanda* is one, then we have the *Krama*, we have the *Kula*, we have the um uh *Pratyabhijñā*. It's, of course, the philosophy, and we have the *Trika*. 

So, I'm not going into all this. It will maybe confusing uh but, those who already have some idea, at least to put these things together. 

So, *Spanda* is, in that sense, one school of Kashmir Shaivism which is integrated with the other schools. And uh some of which are, of course, Tantric traditions. Like, *Kula*, *Kaula*, *Krama*, different Tantric traditions uh *Shakta* also. But uh the *Spanda* school is very, very basic and very important. But however, it's interesting that, in the *Shiva Sutras*, which are the basic text, the term *Spanda* does not occur. It's... I mean, the basic philosophy is the same, but the term *Spanda* doesn't occur. So, I mean, all these texts have to be read very carefully, and um uh why the term *Spanda* doesn't occur in the *Shiva Sutras*, and so on. 

But uh well, *Shiva Sutra* would be a completely different topic for another seminar. Some people wanted to... 

But um no. One advantage uh of teaching *Spanda Kārikā* is that the text is relatively short. It has only 50 verses. But then, we have the commentary, because, without commentary, again, we cannot understand. We will definitely complete these 50 verses in this week, or this uh nine, eight, nine days. The commentary, we have to be selective. Otherwise, we cannot complete it. But definitely, the the verses we will complete uh with uh abbreviation of the commentary.

Now, there are different commentaries. And the one which we are going to follow is by Kṣemarāja, as I said, the disciple of Abhinavagupta. Now, Malatichkovsky, my colleague in Paris, he who has done a thesis on *Spanda*, he has translated other commentaries uh in this book, *The Stanzas on Vibration*. So, those who want to go very deep uh who have time and uh to study that tradition, um these other commentaries are translated by Mark. Now, what we have distributed um is... For those who don't know Sanskrit, one is the translation only of the verses by Mark Dyczkowski. Um which is all in caps, you know, that you have ordered these few pages. So, this is the translation of the entire, all the verses by Mark. It's good.

Okay. So, at least those who don't have a book, they can have uh at least they can see the verses. And uh and the other single sheet which we have distributed is the first *maṅgalaśloka*, which we are going to take up tomorrow now. And these *ślokas* for recitation, that we will learn them slowly uh in spite of my bad voice. But uh somehow, we'll... With all of your cooperation. Sorry. And these are... These are very beautiful verses, which can always be used even before meditation or before teaching, you know? To get into that spirit of the uh non-dual kaśmīr śaivism. So, one of them at the very beginning. 

So, as I said, we will follow the commentary by Kṣemarāja. But, Kṣemarāja's commentary is also too long. So, we will have to shorten it, and um as I said also... So, who knows really Sanskrit apart from Alexander and uh who knows Sanskrit?

I used to know some Sanskrit.

And you are beginners?

That's it. Little bit.

Yeah, yeah. 

Now, because uh see, the commentary by Kṣemarāja on the very first uh *śloka* is called *Spanda Sandoha*. But, it's translated also by Mark uh in this book, *Sensual Vibration*. And it's very beautiful uh commentary.

Yeah.

So, I'll refer to this also, as much as we can manage with the time. But uh we have to at least keep in mind that we want to complete the text, the characters, within uh the limits of this um eight or nine days.

So, I think as an introduction, this um should be enough. And then, tomorrow, we will go to the first verse, what is called *maṅgalaśloka*. In uh any Sanskrit text, this is the verse which brings auspiciousness to the whole teaching. Which invokes the divine, or it uh it makes any undertaking auspicious, free from obstacles, and so on. So, that's what we are going to do tomorrow. 

So, for today, we'll close. It's already overtime a little bit. I hope they... They have kept some *chai* for us. And uh and then, uh yeah, we'll have *chai* on, then at 6:00 is dinner. Probably something in... Yeah. 

Now, this *Śivasūtras of Swami Lakṣmaṇ Joo* uh it's a foreign publication, but there is an Indian co-publisher: Munshiram Manoharlal. Munshiram?

Yes, yes. 

So, what what I again I want to stress is that uh we are now free to talk, anything uh from dinnertime, we'll enter into silence, 6:00. So, if you have any questions, personal, or whatever uh we can do it now. 

Can we do some questions with you now?

Hmm.
