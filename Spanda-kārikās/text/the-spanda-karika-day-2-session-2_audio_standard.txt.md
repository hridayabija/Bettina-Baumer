## Yaś yon meṣān nimeṣābhaṁ cakratāḥ pralayodayau taṁ śakticakravibhavaṁ prabhavaṁ śaṅkhaṁ stumaḥ

Yaś yon meṣān nimeṣābhaṁ cakratāḥ pralayodayau taṁ śakticakravibhavaṁ prabhavaṁ śaṅkhaṁ stumaḥ. Just to come back a little bit to this first _maṅgala_ verse. 

Apart from the many, many other meanings which are there in the commentaries, um, it is clear that every one, especially such a dense verse, has several levels of meaning. So, the apparent, if somebody listens to it for the first time, it seems it concerns the cosmic creation and destruction. And this is also one level. But, as we have seen before, the deeper level is, of course, the um consciousness; what is happening in consciousness. 

Now, regarding this cosmic um _pralayodaya_, uh it is something... it just struck me as an example of how this consciousness is still there in the Indian people. I was present in Orissa when there was a super cyclone and tens of thousands of people were killed. And after that, I was in the middle of it, you know, and then you experience it so directly. Then the people, how do they understand this kind of catastrophe? And one farmer, who was from the coastal, he just survived. His whole family was swept away by the sea, and his whole village, fields, everything was destroyed. And one Oriya journalist... journalist sociologist, he asked the people, "What- what does it mean, this destruction?" And that farmer said so beautifully, you know, when I read it, I was really in tears. He said, "How can the world end so soon? It has just begun!" But what a consciousness! This illiterate farmer, you know, this consciousness of this cosmic cycle! You know, "This world is coming to an end, it has just begun." 

So, this is also, I mean, you keep in the background, you know, this cosmic uh cycle of uh creation, destruction, and whatever is going on in this world, all the time going on. It's not just one *pralaya* and then everything will be finished, but there are so many *pralayas* and so many *udayas*, so many new beginnings, so many new creations. So, this is also a level which is very, very much uh true and which is also very much in the Indian psyche, that this is a- a constantly going on cycle. 

But then, if you go deeper into in- in yoga, in meditation, what does it all mean at the consciousness level? Then, you come to those meanings which we have seen before. And I just want to add uh uh two more meanings, maybe, to this *śakticakra*, um from the *Spanda Sandoha*, very briefly... you don't have that um text... where uh one meaning is that the *śakticakra* means the host of *mantras* and *mudrās*. Now, in the field of yoga, *mantras* and *mudrās* are also considered as deities, as *śaktis*. 

> Its power is the capacity to realize the triple yogic accomplishment. Its source is the locus of its repose and from whence it arises, both of which are implicitly indicated by the word 'source', *prabhava*. 

And um the other meaning, which is also connected with the yogic meaning, and which will come in the later part of the text... 

> The power of the wheel of energies, as explained, is the power of *mantra*. 

Now, of course, *Spanda* has very much to do with *mantra* and with speech, with the word in general, because there is no uh no sound without vibration. And um it is quite understood, and especially *mantra* of course, the power of *mantra* is its power of *spanda*. 

> The power of the wheel of energies is the power of *mantra*. It generates the light and brilliance which shines in the adept's mind and blows, moves, attains, presides over perfumes, and destroys in the sense that it brings it to rest within its- his own nature.

What all *mantras* are doing, it's incredible!

> It moves, attains, presides over perfumes, and destroys in the sense that it brings it to rest within his own nature, 

means the nature of the adept. 

> And so on. And another meaning of um this verse: "in another sense, *śaṅkara* is the source or arising of the teacher who possesses power by virtue of the wheel of energies, which includes initiation, grace, the realization of the deity who is the object of the yogi's meditation, along with the wealth- wealth of other powers."

So here it is the guru who is the... *śaṅkara* is the source of the arising of the guru who possesses that power, that wheel of power. 

So, you can see, there are so many levels of meaning of the same verse. And in this um respect I want to explain something which um again recently we have been discussing in *Śīmbhā Aloka* and so on. Um in the Indian tradition... I have spoken a little bit about *sūtra*. There are different degrees of texts, or categories of text, which are different power. Apart from the revealed text, which are the *Agamas*, or whatever you may call them, *tantra* and so on. But, as we said yesterday, *sūtra* is the... always the original text which has some human author. But then, come different categories of interpretations. And the shortest category of interpretation of *sūtra* is *vṛtti*. I'm going to write it. This is just a brief explanation of what the *sūtra* says. And then, comes- come the other commentaries in different degrees: uh *vivṛti, vibaraṇā, bhāṣya*, and so on and so on. 

Now, what is interesting, that in the Indian tradition, especially this Kaśmīr Śaiva tradition, they are so conscious of what is going on in all these texts. They associate these levels of the text with levels of the word. See what we're doing here? We are using language. We are interpreting language. We are expressing it in- in words, *vaikharī*. But, these words, and this language, and this text should lead us beyond the word, ultimately to silence. So, the whole Kaśmīr Śaivism has developed this um teaching of the four levels of the word. Four levels of speech. *Parā* is the transcendent source of language, source of the word, which is beyond language, beyond thought, beyond everything. That it's the source. It's a pure unity. Pure unity. Pure unity. It's a *turiya. Turiya. Turiya*. It's a *turiya, turiya*. Yeah, but yes. Of many, there are so many degrees of word which are *turiya* is corresponds to the... 

*Parāvak* is the level of the word which is not yet expressed, either in thought or in words and language. It is the purely intuitive level. It's like when a poet has a sudden intuition, you know, but it's not... has not yet formulated in his mind. That is *Paśyantī*. It's a sudden insight which is just between the transcendent and the language. It is just in between. And then, when it comes to the level of thought, because in thought we already use language, that is called *Madhyamā*. That is the intermediary level of language. And only in the last, lowest stage, it comes to the spoken, uttered word. Of course, spoken is always more important than written. The written word is always secondary in the Indian tradition. 

*Vaikharī*. *Vaikharī* means also the embodied one, which uses the vocal organs, the body to express. 

Now, what is interesting is that, of course, *Parā* is beyond, but they have associated *sūtra* with the level of *Paśyantī*, which means that at this very beginning, original expression, and *kārikā* belongs to the category of *sūtra*. It is very close to the source of the word, to the transcendent source. And that's why also *sūtra* uses a minimum number of words. And you know that what the paṇḍits say, *arthamātra laghvina*. You know this *arthamātra laghvina*? "Putra, but uh pu- putrotsava iva uh mānyante vyākaraṇam." The grammarians, they rejoice as much about reducing one syllable as about the birth of a son. Because they- they want to express it in the briefest possible way, because the briefer, the closer you are to the source. We use so many words for saying nothing sometimes, but the more you come to the essence, the brief- the briefer your speech becomes.  

And *Madhyamā* corresponds to *vṛtti*. And *Vaikharī* to all kinds of other commentaries, uh which are more explicit and more extensive. And *Āgama* corresponds to *Parā*. *Āgama*. But *Parā* is beyond, you know? But, *Āgama* is in... that is between the *Parā* and *Paśyantī*. *Vaikharī*... well, the *Āgama* comes from *Parā*, of course. Of course. Because it's not a human uh... it's no human author. 

>So we was always the we...

Yes, yes. 

Now, why I am saying this? Because these *kārikās* also um... they have a greater power. They are... they are so brief, and in that brevity they have more power, and more, of course, possibility of being explained in so many different ways. Now, we do have a *vṛtti* to the *kārikās*, on the *kārikās*, and that is by Kallaṭa, the direct disciple of Vasugupta. So, Vasugupta is the author of the *Spanda Kārikā*, and Kallaṭa is his direct disciple. And he must have been a great sage also, and great uh... because he's quoted always with the greatest respect. So, his *vṛtti* is that which corresponds here to um to *Madhyamā*. So, the language at the level of thought is still more concentrated, and the moment it is spoken out, and it flows out into multitude of words, and uh so many explanations, and so on. But, the purpose is, in the text and in the practice always, to go back from the many words back to the simplicity. And ultimate... ultimate simple word is, of course, the *mantra*. The monosyllabic *mantra* is the ultimate abbreviation of language, which is sometimes really placed at the level of *Parā*. 

And so, to lead back. As Abhinavagupta says so beautifully at the end of his book on *Vāc*: "This is ultimately... it all leads back to silence." So, that's why this whole connection between our studying the text and sitting in meditation, and so on. Because... it has to lead back to that source- source of the word.

Now, the *sūtras* has so... *sūtra* here means the *kārikās*, also brief. And you will be surprised that the title is *Tantra kārikā*. You have to go on searching, searching, searching to find the word *spanda*. So, the first time the word *spanda* comes in the *kārikā* is in verse 22. And that too, in very, very interesting context. We are going to read it later, because I don't want to jump now, but in a very experiential context. Not as a kind of philosophical definition. Not, "This... now we are going to define what is *spanda*." No, no, not at all. Just in a context of experience. An experience which comes very close to what we did last year on the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. You know, just that moment in which something happens, and that is *spanda*. But, not before. So, before, you can see, he's going round about and building up the whole background, and so on. It's not so direct like the *Vijñāna Bhairava*. 

So, those who are not familiar with the Kashmir Śaivism, they need a little patience to go through this verses which are a little more... I wouldn't say theoretical, but still, it becomes more and more practical as we proceed. But that background has to be built up. 

So... we come to the second- second *kārikā*. And why I say this? Because at the level of *Paśyanti*, these multiple meanings are possible. So, every verse can have, as we said before, the first was related to the cosmo- cosmic creation and destruction, or to the inner consciousness, and so on and so on. So many different levels. So, also the second verse, page 24, 25... 24... 24, page 24 is:

> yatrasthitaṃ idaṃ sarvaṃ kāryaṃ yas mātsannyṛgataṃ /
tasya anāvṛtatarūpatvāt nanirudhosti kutracit //

Now, again this is typical of a *sūtra*, because he doesn't say *yatra* means "in which." It's just... or this relative pronouns: "in which, in what." Probably in *Śaṅkara*. *Śaṅkara*, who has been mentioned in the first verse. *Yatra*: "in whom," or "in- in which." *Sthitam idaṃ sarvam*: "all this is established." See, I am- I am a very stingy translator, because whenever I translate, I don't add words. So, if it is necessary, only in bracket. Now, Jaideva Singh was a great friend of mine. His weakness is that he goes on adding words to make more. But these words, you have to put it in brackets, because there's no questions *spanda* here. But he put, sometimes, the words from the commentary into the- into the text. But, here he doesn't do it, but in other places he does. Well, in his translation.

> Inasmuch as nothing can veil his nature, there cannot be his obstruction anywhere in whom all this world rests and from whom it has come forth. 

And the Mark's translation... Again, in Mark I have cut him out "the creation." He says "creation," which I don't like. 

> That in which all this is established and from whence it arises is nowhere obstructed because it is unconditioned by its very nature. 

See, "creation" already limits it to one act of the five acts, first of all. And then, it is such a typical expression in Kashmir Śaivism, *idaṃ sarvam*: "all this." "All this" means the whole universe. You don't need to add anything, either creation or anything. "All this." This means *idaṃ* means "to which you can point" as an object. The objective world. And you have the two poles. There are only two poles in the whole universe. That is *idaṃ*, and that is *aham*. And everything is a combination of the two. Of one or the other is predominant. *Aham* means subjectivity, *idaṃ* means objectivity. And now, the whole world is an expansion of *aham* into *idaṃ*, and then, *idaṃ aham*. Combination. These are different stages, different levels of manifestation. So, *idaṃ*, this... just this... *aham*. 

> So that is a manifestation, manifestation, manifestation of the, of the Supreme Consciousness. 

Yeah, yeah. Now, this- this verse has, of course, a philosophical implications and spiritual implications. Now, the philosophical implications is... that... to see the style of the commentators is always to introduce a verse by saying, "The possible objection to the previous verse would be that..." and then, the answer is in the following verse. 

So, the possible objection is here:

> A doubt may be raised: "What is the proof of the existence of such real nature as *Śaṅkara*? How can he create the world without any means, such as material, etcetera?"

Because they are arguing against the- the- the systems of philosophy which presuppose a material cause of the universe. So, and this doctrine is based on a pure *svatantra-vāda* means total freedom, total independence. Independence also of any other cause. So, this is one of the philosophical reasons for making such a statement.

> "If it be said that there can be both..." 

That is the doubt raised. 

> "...There can be both appearance and disappearance of the Lord, then this would give rise to difference- difference in his nature..."

And so on. 

>"...And there would be contingency of duality. To remove all such doubts with one stroke, the author says..." 

So, one philosophical doubt which has to be removed is that there is no other cause, no material cause, or any other cause; that everything is contained in that reality. 

Of course, *yatra*, we have seen what is *Śaṅkara*. *Śaṅkara* is our very own innermost nature, so it is again not simply a theistic statement. But, we are more interested in the spiritual implications of this statement, which are very great. And this verse is often quoted, you know, when the doubt arises, you know, there are so many obstacles. "How can we realize the divine? How can we..." you know, "There's so many things obstruct us and- and so on." 

So, to immediately remove this kind of doubt, which is a spiritual doubt, this verse is quoted. 

>"There can be no obstruction whatever." 

Just that one phrase is quoted in such cases. *Tasya anāvṛtatarūpatvāt nanirudhosti kutracit*. "Because there is no obstruction anywhere." Now, in the commentary, *yatra*... Now, this- this is very typical also of this author's... these very brief statements that... to use just this relative pronouns. 

There's this one beautiful verse which is commented upon by Abhinavagupta in the *Parātrīśikā Vivaraṇa*. And the verse comes from the *Mahābhārata*:

> yasmin sarvaṃ yataḥ sarvaṃ yaḥ sarvaḥ sarvadaścayaḥ /
yaśca sarvamayonijyam tasmai sarvātmane namaḥ //

"In whom everything is. From whom everything comes. Who is everything and everywhere. Who is immanent in all things eternally. Him, the self of all, do I adore." 

So, it's all the cases of Sanskrit grammar: "in whom, from whom, who," etcetera, etcetera. So, all the possible relationships, you know, from... it's just relative pronounce. And then, Abhinavagupta... Abhinavagupta goes on commenting every single part of this. *Yasmin sarvam*. He goes on pages and pages. *Yataḥ sarvam*. And this is beautifully expounded in the *Parātrīśikā Vivaraṇa*. That would be a text to teach, but that requires more than a week. 

So, this reminds me this *yatra*. The same kind of expression: "in whom," or "in which." So, *yatra* means, "in that consciousness which is one's own self," as it had been said before, *Śaṅkara*. *Idaṃ sarvaṃ kāryaṃ* means, "the entire world consisting of subject or knower, means of knowledge, knowledge, and object unknown." *Yatrasthitaṃ idaṃ sarvaṃ kāryaṃ*, therefore, means, "in which consciousness this world consisting of subject, object, and means of knowledge, etcetera rests." 

By "rests," *sthitaṃ*, is meant, "by whose light it comes into light and thus obtains stance." 

>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 

*Sthitaṃ idaṃ*. It is established, because nothing is established according to this philosophy and spirituality which is not shining in that light. *Prakāśa tat tu ayaṃ citātma Bhagavān nitya asāhā*. This is another... Sorry, sorry, sorry. I marked it. And this verse is even also a kind of answer to... in the *Śiva Sūtra Vimarshini* of Kṣemarāja, we find some verses which are critical of yoga. And you remember, because there, Upaladeva says, "Well, the yogis, they think only when there in *samādhi*, then only they are in that state. But otherwise, if they are out of *samādhi*, what happens?" 

And here also, it's a little criticism, you know, that this state is not dependent on anything. Not even dependent on any *prāṇāyāma*, or *samādhi*, or... it is always there. It is always established. And that it is a completely different attitude than, "Now I have to do so much of meditation and *prāṇāyāma* and this that..." And then only... No, it is always there. Is always established. Ever established. And- and it makes a lot of difference. 

When he quotes from the *Acaraparamārthacittī* of Utpaladeva... 

>How can he be checked by *prāṇa*, because he is identical with it? Even *prāṇa* is also nothing but that in which everything is established and so on.

So, it's not by *prāṇāyāma*, or by any uh breath control, that he can be... *prāṇena yantṛṇaḥ*. 

>So that... *ātmanaiva tasya svāt kathaṁ prāṇena yantṛṇā*. 

It's that illusion which yogis sometimes have, that because they are doing a certain practice, and then through that practice they will reach the state, and so on. But he said, "No, there is no object. There is no reservation. There is no obstacle at all, uh in any condition." And that's the whole purpose of- of the whole spirituality, to reach a state of consciousness which is not bound to any particular practice, or any particular uh... which can be applied at any time and any condition, any situation, uh and without depending. It doesn't mean that one shouldn't do *prāṇāyāma* and so on, or whatever uh... there is no objection to it. But one should not think that this state depends on this uh practice. That's what he quotes from the- the *Acaraparamārthacittī*. 

Then, there's a question about um... he goes on uh raising objections and answering to these objections. 

Now, "in whom it rests," *yatrastitam idaṃ sarvam*. And here he quotes that beautiful words from the same *Parātriśikā Tantra*, which uh... one of my favorite verses in the whole tradition:

> yatānyagrodabījasta śaktir drumo mahāṁ mahāṁ /
drumaḥ tathā hṛdayabījastaṁ jagad etac carācaram // 

It's beautiful words from the *Parātriśikā Tantra*. 

> "As the great banyan tree lies only in the form of potency in the seed, even so the entire universe, with all the mobile and immobile beings, lies at the... as a potency in the heart seed of the supreme." 

Now, this "heart seed," *hṛdayabīja*, "the seed of the heart," is actually technically, it's a *mantra*. The seed of the heart, *hṛdayabīja*. But, it can be um... it has been always interpreted like that. But, the- the point is here, because we're speaking of *śakti*. The tiny seed of the banyan tree has the potency of producing that huge tree, with all its roots, and- and which can give uh shade to so many creatures. And in the same way that smallness is emphasized. The small seed can produce that huge tree. The same way, that one seed of the heart, which is this "heart *mantra*," it can produce that... *hṛdayabījastaṁ*. That power which holds the- the whole universe. So, here he... 

>Since there is no obstruction to this... Those who have the book, on page 30, bottom, and 31.

>There is no obstruction to this and, well, *Spanda* principle is... 

Yeah, okay. Cimmerbatch says:

> Whether in the state of cessation, as indicated by the phrase *yathā sthitam*, or in the state of expansion, as indicated by the phrase... yeah, *asmat chaniyogatam*. Therefore, the yogi should be intent on entrance into his essential nature in both *nimīlana* and *unmīlana samādhi*.

And uh... this is the yogic meaning, that both um *samādhi* with closed eyes... I mean, "closed eyes" and "open eyes" is just an external um description, but uh what is actually uh the experience is- is- is more than that. It's more than just closing and opening the eyes, because uh opening the eyes is very easy, but if you are in that *unmīlana samādhi*, it's a very, very high state. It's a very high state. 

And then, of course, he quotes um uh... he falls into the temptation which I am also in, to quote the text a little further ahead. 

> "When agitation ceases, then occurs the highest state..."

That is one of the most famous phrases of the *Spanda Kārikā*. *Yadā kṣobha palīyate tadāsyādbhra* being the... It was probably, and putting it into order and so, they were... He was a disciple of Bāladeva, and Kalhaṭa was a disciple of Vasugupta. So, as we have seen, the *Vṛtti* is always a very short commentary. So, the *Vṛtti* to the second verse is:

> "How can we say that Śiva is one's own essential nature, *svasvabhāva,* subject as it is to transmigration?"

If asked this question, we would reply that, 

>"That in which this universe is established and from whence it arises is never obscured, even during the round of rebirths. Thus, it is nowhere subject to limitation and so it is said to be Śiva." 

It's very brief. 

>And the third one... Yeah, I think the introduction... I'm sorry that I'm mixing these uh commentaries, but I think it is uh helpful, because reading the entire uh *Spandanirṇaya* of Kṣemarāja is not possible. But, these short commentaries, they- they are helpful.

Now, introducing the third uh verse, uh Rājānaka Rāma, he- he writes the following, which gives the whole background. 

>"Now, must one accept the existence of this principle," *bhaṭṭa,* "here called 'own nature,' and that it is such as we have said it is, solely on the basis of scriptural authority? Or can its existence be admitted on the basis of sound reasoning or personal experience?"

See, always the three: *āgama, svānubhāva,* and *tarka*, or uh *yukti*, or *upapatti*. 

> The argument advanced in the following verses to counter this doubt can be introduced as follows:

> "The root cause of the knot of division, so hard to severe, is the ego, *ahaṃpratyaya*."

Now, here we get the whole psychology. Root cause of all division is the ego. And the limited ego, *ahaṃpratyaya*.

> It is a state of subjectivity, projected unto its object, namely, the body, et cetera.

So, the identification of the ego with the body, the mind, the um uh sense organs, etcetera.

> The development of this embodied egoity amounts to a fall from one's own most authentic nature, *svasvabhāva,* the true subject, *pāramārthika*. It afflicts every single conscious subject overcome by the power of *Māyā*, that extends its sway as the darkness of the Great Illusion of duality. *Māyā* is destroyed and deprived of all essence, like a mound of snow touched by the rays of the sun, when one reflects on one's own essential nature, *svasvabhāva,* guided by that most excellent insight, *prajñā,* which has become firm and unwavering through a profound understanding of the meaning and reality this entire treatise seeks to expound. 

See, the whole point here is raised that you have to move from this limited ego to the true essential nature.

> In order to distinguish the I-notion, which is one's own true nature, from the body and the rest of the psychophysical organism, and so enable us to perceive that perfectly unconditioned reality of which he spoke before, the master says, introducing a sound argument validated by personal experience to support his teaching. 

So, that's the introduction to this verse. And then, the *Vṛtti* to this verse three says, 

> "Even while perceiving distinctions among the forms of consciousness brought about by waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, his authentic nature is never obscured. This is because, in all three states, the perceiving subjectivity is the same. His nature does not change, just as poison pervades all five parts of a toxic plant, including its sprout."

The- the example is very funny.

> I'm on page 86. On page 86. Um yeah. Yeah, verse 17. Verse 17, he says, "The fully enlightened has"... 36. It is I- it's 17. Uh p- page 86 is. Yeah. "Uh the fully enlightened has always and incessantly the undeviating knowledge of the self in all the three states." Yeah. The other one, "Who is the partially enlightened has it only at the beginning of an- an- and end of each state." Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, this will come, and this uh uh this will come in a later *sūtra*. Uh but you... Yeah, all three states of... Yeah, now, uh th- this will... it will come later that we can uh... Since the commentary says it, there is a special verse on that. 

The difference between the enlightened one and the fully enlightened one is: the enlightened one, he experiences that *Spanda* at the beginning and end of any state. But, the fully enlightened one, he experiences it throughout. Now, "beginning and end," we had it in the *Vijñānabhairava*. I think most of you have done *Vijñānabhairava*. Because at the... whether it's a beginning of the breath arising, breathing in or breathing out, the- the beginning point, or the beginning point of any experience, any emotion, any um sensation, any sense perception. So, that beginning point... this is, of course, one of the most central uh spiritual practices of the entire school. This is called uh *prathame prathamamāṁśa*, and there are different um words for that. The awareness of the beginning point. So, this is, actually, the- the- the secret um... secret of this whole practice. Awareness of the point of origin. And uh that is something which can be practiced, which can be uh... of course, awareness has to become more and more subtle, and then to- to become aware of that point where something arises. 

And why does he give uh uh uh this very funny sounding example, where, 

>"For the first time, the word *Spanda* comes in verse 22, *atikrāntoparidṛṣṭavatkimi karoti divāniśam*."

In the state of extreme anger... why does he start with anger? But, because in the state of anger, you know, so much of emotion gets uh together that it's easier to get at the point of its origin. See, very soft emotions, you- you- you're not so... it's not so easy to go to the point of its origin. But, when you get really angry in some situation, you know, and suddenly you get... catch yourself in- in that moment, i- it is something so strong that it's easier to go back than in any other gentle emotion, or- or something, where uh you don't really find that point, uh it's not easy to find that point. So, that's why I think psychologically he gives that example. 

Uh, "*Atikrāntopari" *- dṛṣṭavatkimi karoti divāniśam*.** This is one of the most famous verses of the *Spandakārikā* which summarizes the whole of the *Vijñānabhairava*. Because *Vijñānabhairava* is, of course, that scripture, that *āgama*, on which it is based. And the beautiful thing is uh that was not in the *Vijñānabhairava*, but this is specific to the *Spandakārikā*. It's not only being extremely angry, or extremely happy, but being in a state of uncertain, "What should I do?" *Kimi karoti divāniśam*. So, a state of, you know, in- in- indecision. Um we know, in our life, you know, sometimes we suddenly we got the wrong bus or something, you know. So, *kimi karoti*. So, in that state, where you- you are lost, "What should I do now?" or... But in that state, your mind is emptied from uh from other thoughts, you know, and you're so um yeah, so emptied that uh uh you enter into that state of *Spanda*. So, I like this expression very much. We'll come to that. Verse 22. Just be patient, we have to. 

> Um please, tell me if it is too long with the text, and if you are getting tired, uh we can also stop at some point, and then uh... No, fine. I just... I know I have to pick up speed uh uh from tomorrow, but um...

> On an average you should do five, six. Huh? On an average you should do at least five to six verses. 

Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. At least. 

>At the day. So-... No, no. We are right. We are- but, uh her exposition will not be available. That's too much to take in in a day. 

Yes, fully right. 

>And of course um um... And of course um... Uh maybe uh we uh we take the end of the commentary, which is also very beautiful because in the- in the light of a non-dual um system, you know, who is there? Who is the separate subject? Is there any separate subject?
