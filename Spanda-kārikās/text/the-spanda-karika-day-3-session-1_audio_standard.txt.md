## Let us start with a Complex Task: Unveiling the Secrets of Spanda

This document presents an edited and annotated transcript of a lecture focusing on the concept of Spanda within the philosophical framework of Kashmir Shaivism. The lecture seamlessly blends linguistic analysis, cultural understanding, and philosophical discourse, demanding a multifaceted approach to fully grasp its profound insights. We have taken the liberty to structure the text, enhancing its readability and clarity while meticulously preserving the entirety of the original content. 

### The Essence of Spanda: A Journey Through Experience

**Let us start with our two *maṅgala śloka*s** which we have learned, the one of yesterday:

> *yaśo me śānti me śābhyāṁ jagat tāpalau dayau /
> taṁ śakti cakra vibhavā prabhavaṁ śaṅkaras tumaḥ //*

> *yaśo me śānti me śābhyāṁ jagat tāpalau dayau /
> taṁ śakti cakra vibhavā prabhavaṁ śaṅkaras tumaḥ //*

Once more:

> *yaśo me śānti me śābhyāṁ jagat tāpalau dayau /
> taṁ śakti cakra vibhavā prabhavaṁ śaṅkaras tumaḥ //* 

Now, the first one was different:

> *ākṛtā saṁśayaṁ buddhiḥ samudranāthāriniṁ /
> vande vicitrātapadaṁ citrāṁtaṁ gurupārvatīm //*

> *ākṛtā saṁśayaṁ buddhiḥ samudranāthāriniṁ /
> vande vicitrātapadaṁ citrāṁtaṁ gurupārvatīm //*

> *ākṛtā saṁśayaṁ buddhiḥ samudranāthāriniṁ /
> vande vicitrātapadaṁ citrāṁtaṁ gurupārvatīm //*

It's a little more difficult. Once more: 

> *ākṛtā saṁśayaṁ buddhiḥ samudranāthāriniṁ /
> vande vicitrātapadaṁ citrāṁtaṁ gurupārvatīm //* 

Although I have been urged to go faster, and I will also do it, but you please forgive me if I go back once to the very first *śloka* and to one meaning (of course it has so many meanings). It says: *"vicitrātapadaṁ gurupārvatīm"*. It has so many meanings, but one meaning I didn't want us to miss out, and because it's a very basic concept of Kashmir Śaivism and of the entire spirituality. And that is the concept that everything is related to everything else: *sarvaṁ sarvātmakam*. 

And he gives one of the interpretations (him and Śrī Maharaja), one of the interpretations of this first *śloka*, he explains in in that light that everything is related to everything else because this whole manifestation is an expression of the divine freedom, total freedom: *svātantrya*. And, uh, well, in the Sanskrit text, it would be page six, in the translation, page 11. 

But I'm not going into the details, but only to… There is a process of, in the whole of Śaiva, not only cosmology, but, uh, what not (quote) uh, *paṇḍitā kosmotāntrik* means everything is connected: the cosmic, the divine, and the human, they are connected. So the thirty-six *tattva*s of the Śaiva cosmology are not only cosmology. You have the cosmos from the earth upwards, and then you have the human elements: the senses, even the internal senses, and so on. And then you have the divine levels, levels of divine manifestation, uh, from *sadāśiva*, *īśvara*, *śakti*, and *śiva*, and with all the intermediates that… it's all a… it's all a hierarchy of continuity.

There's only one break in that hierarchy, and that is *māyā*. **Māyā** is the limit. So that whatever is below *māyā tattva* is called the impure parts, and what is above *māyā*, starting with *śuddhāvidyā*, the pure wisdom, is called the pure parts. And parts means that there is always a double movement, and this is this whole *śakti cakra* going on, the movement of descent from the divine down to the earth and ascent from the earth to the divine. 

And this movement is also constantly, uh, going on. Not only is it the movement of descending and ascending, but it's also a movement of constant interrelatedness, total interrelatedness. And that is where what Abhinavagupta develops most extensively in his commentary on the *Parātrīśikātantra*, that every single element is connected with every other other element. Well, even the word "element" is not the right translation of *tattva*, but, um, some people translated as "level of reality" or, uh, "category," but "category" is a bit too abstract. 

So this interconnectedness is something, uh, some basic insight, uh, without which you cannot understand, uh, whatever is going to follow now, both in practice and in in theory. Because if you disconnect, if you take out elements in the disconnected way, then you have missed, uh, the whole point. 

So he says here, um: *evaṁ ca sarvaṁ sarvātmakam sarvamayam eva prathayati.* Everything (means every, uh, detail, every element, um) manifests the totality. So every, uh, single entity reveals the totality. And that is, of course, a vision which you have to acquire by by practicing things which we have learnt in *Vijñānabhairava*. It's not… it doesn't come automatic. And as we have the beautiful example of Utpaladeva, uh, which, uh, is one of my favourite verses in the whole of this tradition, where he says… maybe I'm… I'm tempted to to quote Utpaladeva, which even Śrī Maharaja is tempted to. I'm not alone in this. 

> With my eyes closed, relishing within the wonder of inner devotion, may I worship even the blades of grass as glory to Śiva, to myself. 
>
> *antaḥprakticamatkāra carvaṇāmilitaścanaḥ / 
namas me śivāyeti pūjayaṁs tṛṇāny api //*

So even the blades of grass, which belong categorically to the element earth, even they are Śiva, but you have to experience that only when you go into that internal state of absorption where all these differences disappear. And they don't disappear in a kind of, uh, mix-up. That is a total misunderstanding. It's not a mix-up. The elements are clearly distinguished, but they are clearly interconnected. So it's not, uh, you know, *khicṛī* where everything is, uh… but, um, it is you experience, uh, *śiva* in the blade of grass. So the blade of grass is still a blade of… It has, of course, different implications, and sometimes in the plural, means, um, states of consciousness or perceptions or, um, cognitions also, or perceptions or cognitions, states of consciousness.

So he starts actually… when he starts analyzing… and we know this methodologies, it was also in the *Bhagavad-Gītā*, you know, starting analyzing the ordinary consciousness. What happens in the ordinary human beings, uh, what kinds of experiences and, um, how they identify these experiences, and then to proceed from there and to rise to the higher states of consciousness. 

Now, um… And there is another interesting, um, level of interpretation that one level would be that these, uh, states reside really in *śaṅkara*, or in that highest consciousness, but not only. He gives another interpretation where he says: *"anyatra"* does not mean in *śaṅkara*, who is a compact mass of light and bliss, and who is our own essential nature as it is accepted by us. Therefore, the self is not always tarnished by the conditions of pleasure, pain, etc., but is rather of the nature of consciousness. When he, by his own impurity (to be described later) conceals his essential nature and appears in that state, then he is in the *puryāṣṭaka* state.

Now what means *puryāṣṭaka*? It is the city of eight, literally. And the city is the body, and the body has eight constituent elements, and these are: the five senses, the *manas*, *buddhi*, and *ahaṃkāra*: the mind, the intellect, and the ego-sense. So this, um, this is always intriguing for Western, uh, psychologist that Indian psychology puts the mind, the intellect, and the ego all together with the senses. It's all at the level of the senses. It's not yet the what in the West we would call the soul or spirit and so on. It's all part of a psycho-physical, uh, entity which we are. So *puryāṣṭaka* is really the technical term that it includes *manas*, *buddhi*, *ahaṃkāra*. 

So these states (I'm happy, I'm unhappy, and so on and so on), they have their basis, if you talk psychologically, in the *puryāṣṭaka*. So they are caused by this, uh, emotions, the sense experience, and so on. So their basis is the, uh… it's sometimes also translated "the psychic apparatus." I don't like the word "apparatus," but the psychic, uh, body we can say, uh, subtle body also, the the subtle body. 

And he has the experience of happiness, etc. It has already been said that even in that state, pleasure, etc., cannot obstruct his real nature. He is never concealed by pleasure, etc. 

Now this is again referring to the second, uh, *śloka* where he says nothing can obstruct him. So even those very plain and basic experiences which we are identifying with, or our individual psychic, uh, body, even those cannot obstruct him. This is the great… going back to the second, uh, *śloka*. 

The real purport in saying "I'm happy," "I'm miserable," etc., by abandoning such beliefs as "I am thin," "I'm fat," etc., is this: one recognizes one's essential nature… it is called *moha*, but *vimoha*. It is also state of confusion. It's a kind of the third state that that *asti paramārthatā*. 

So now here, I I agree with that *sūtra* style, you know, don't say what it is, only "it is not this," "it is nothing that exists in reality": that *asti paramārthatā*. But it's just a negation, see? There is neither happiness nor sadness, nor subject nor object, nor confusion, that is in reality. And that reminds us of the *Vigaṇabhairava* where he says, uh, well, if you deny all this, if you empty all that, what remains: that *tattvam avaśiṣyate*, the reality alone remains. So don't name it, don't say what is that reality, don't give it a name (again, we are applying our own mind, our own *vikalpa*), but just that is… neither pleasure nor pain, nor confusion, nor subject nor object, that exists in reality: that *asti paramārthatā*. So this comes much closer to that, um, true negation of what we find so strongly in Buddhism. So that if Singh has added this *spanda* principle and so on, so just put it in bracket, but that exists in reality. 

And then he gives a… So I'm… I'm really in good company because I'm so happy. Not only my master, Swami Lakṣmaṇjoo, but Śrī Ramaṇamaharṣi already, they were fond of the two texts of which I am also most fond, that is *Vigaṇabhairava* and *Śivastotrāvalī*, and which was all the time Swamiiji's lips all the time. But even starting from Chenālaya, it's very much in the tradition. 

And the interesting thing is that the two texts are so different. The *Vigaṇabhairava* is typical tantra, and *Śivastotrāvalī* is typical *bhakti*, uh, but they are so complementary. So he also quotes again and again from *Śivastotrāvalī*, and he always calls Utpaladeva *rahasyatattvavit*, the knower of the secret, the knower of the mystery. And this *rahasyatattva*, he doesn't mean that *īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā*, he means the *Śivastotrāvalī*, the the, as you say, the mystic. 

Then they ask, "What do you mean by mystic?" So it doesn't necessarily mean a *paṇḍit* who knows all the *śāstra*s, but who has that experience. And that experience is expressed in the *Śivastotrāvalī*. So now, um… We begin. And then, uh, the… See what he says, that these experiences which are here denied… that whatever inner object that is, like, being, pleasure, etc., or whatever external object, that like blue or yellow or whatever. But the subject, like the *puryāṣṭaka* body and senses, have evidently no existence. When they are experienced, then, being experienced, they are of the nature of consciousness, and that is the… they are simply consciousness, and so on.

**Can I have a question?**

**Hm?**

**Can I have a question? Yeah, I mean, like, we, like ordinary human beings, we have some particular type of consciousness, what you already said, "human," or give some word, "ordinary consciousness." So as far as we are concerned, these states of happiness and the look and all these things, how should we, as a human being, observe them? I mean, what what should be the state of our consciousness that time?**

But that's what he just stated in the last *sūtra*. That's what he just said, that to be aware that these… all these states arise from your *puryāṣṭaka*, means from your own, uh, psychological makeup, if you want to call it like that. And then this psychological makeup, this is not the final thing. This, you have to merge it into the your divine nature. That's what he said at the end, very clearly said. So what you do in your meditation, or in your spiritual practice, is precisely transforming these experiences and and the basis of these experiences, which is your limited individuality, and then merging it into that, uh, your own divine nature, from *Śivastotrāvalī*. So that's what he just said.

And here it is one step further. It is one step further, which means to say that these, uh, states don't exist: neither subject nor object, nor, uh, happiness nor sadness; neither subject nor object, nor, uh, happiness nor sadness. Yeah, now he gives one, um… There are two interpretations of *mūḍhabhāva*, so either it is a state of confusion, as I said, or it is a state of insentiency, which means *jaḍa*. Now, in the whole, um, system, there is no… nothing which is totally insentient. And that's precisely the *spanda*, *spanda* which is underlying the whole of reality, which means there's nothing which is insentient, nothing which is simply, uh, uh, how do you call, not material (of course it is material), but it is… everything is filled with consciousness. 

So that's what Utpaladeva just said, you know, even the blade of grass is, uh, is full of the same consciousness, but to experiencing… to experience it, you must go through a process of transformation. And that transformation is precisely transformation of your individual, uh, limited… identifying yourself with your mind and your body and your senses and your external conditionings, and so on. That transformation has to take place, and then you perceive the whole world in a different way, and everything becomes vibrant with that, um, that *spanda*, and that… Everything becomes transparent.

Now he goes into the question that the commentary goes into the question of *prakāśavimarśa*, and, uh, there he has a, um… he has a… he's hitting at the Vedāntins. But there's a very… I'm sorry, I cannot resist using this quotation. Um… He says, "What happens…" It's not Abhinavagupta, he quotes Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka. Now Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka was one of the greatest aestheticians and, uh, and the poeticians of Kashmir, who was strongly influenced, um, by Abhinavagupta in the field of, uh, poetics. And he… this this quotation is, uh, sometimes found when it's a question that the people… the Vedāntins, they don't recognize *śakti*. See, for them, Brahman is everything. 

Then he says: *na pumsa gamitā-anutāparaṁ brahma phalatyakṛtat tadba-ughośinīyoktvit cet na syāttaccakti-sundarī*. Again, I don't like this translation…  See, your your supreme Brahman, which is neuter, and neuter means also eunuch, uh, how can it bring any fruit unless it is, um, stimulated by this beautiful energy, *śakti*? Unless it is stimulated by this beautiful *śakti*, how can it produce anything?

So that's the criticism of, uh, of Brahman… of the Vedāntic Brahman by, of course, by a poetician, but it has been quoted many times that without *śakti*, how can you have anything: any creation, any any manifestation, any, uh… Any beauty also. But it's not only beauty, it's the whole of reality which depends on the on *śakti*. So…

**So manifestation… Uh, *śakti* is stimulated by Śiva, or is Śiva stimulated by *śakti*? Well, I mean, he says Brahman should be… Brahman should be stimulated by *śakti*, but Brahman being an eunuch, so how can he be…?**

But in Kashmiri Śaivism, the base is supposed to be Śiva and and…

**Well, they are… they are in, uh… they are undivided, so you cannot, um, give any priority. But *śakti* is… It is a *bheda*, but it is a dynamic… I mean, the *śakti* means dynamic, dynamism. So that dynamism, uh, is, uh, inherent in the the divine reality itself.** 

So again, what we talked yesterday, that, uh, we start… the Indian thinker start always from grammar, because, uh, the gender of the word is very important. If Brahman is in neuter gender, that means he cannot be stimulated by the beauty of, uh, that lady *śakti*. So this, uh… it's a play with the words also, but by the way, also hitting at some philosophical, um, basic, um, idea, which is in in Kashmir Śaivism, that *prakāśa vimarśa* and *Śivaśakti* are complementary. 

Now how this, uh, comes here… I'm not going into the entire argument, otherwise you will say I'm going to slow…

**Which I will say.**

Now, let us come… I'm… I'm always trying to, um, go to the more spiritual interpretation than leaving aside the more philosophical ones, which are also necessary, but it requires more time. When he goes into argument and counter-argument that somebody could be objecting this and that, and the response to that and so on. But we are coming to the, uh, page 48-49, um… And the Sanskrit also… I like to read the Sanskrit, 46, the last… better.

Moreover, when in that noble person who attentively pursues the teaching of the… meeting a perfect, uh, being… a meeting a great master… and that everything is *camatkāra*. But whenever you are overwhelmed by by an experience which produces something new… Wonder means you you wonder like a child discover something new. You just look at it, his eyes… You know, this is some new discovery. And, uh, that, uh, freshness, that newness, that is *camatkāra*. 

And in the *Śivasūtra*s, and we again and again we have to refer back to the *Śivasūtra*s… There is this beautiful *sūtra*: *viṣmayo yogabhūmikā*. Now *camatkāra* and *viṣmaya* are, in a way, uh, uh, synonyms, but not exactly synonyms, but still they are used in the same, uh, sense. *Viṣmayo yogabhūmikā*. The stages of yoga are full of wonder. So every new stage, uh, brings a new sense of surprise, you know? It's a surprise. It's not that when you have read it in the book, and then you say, "Oh, yes, *accha*. This is what I have just…" But it's not like that, you know. You must be overwhelmed, uh, uh, and something unexpected. Even if you have read it in the book, but when you actually experience it, it's quite different. It is a, uh, it always, uh, uh, wonderful, and… 

So that is this *camatkāra*, which he has translated as "delight"… give me some… 

So this passage, uh, is very beautiful, and which summarizes… because to him everything… thank you… appears only as quintessence, as, uh, *sāra* of the… Wonder of Spanda is not even there. *Sarvasya etat camatkāra ekarasa eka sāratvāt*. Spanda is not there. *Sukha Dukha eka sāratvāt*. No, again, you have to put the… that thing into bracket. *Spanda* as the quintessence of the essence of this, um, wonder, wonder of delight, whatever you may…

And then in a wonder, he now quotes his *Mahāguruḥ*, *Mahāguravāḥ*. And this *Mahāguraḥ vā* means "in plural," is again Utpaladeva. 

And *Spanda* is even… the second one is not even there in the Sanskrit.  *Spanda* is not in the Sanskrit, no? That's what I say, you put it in bracket. 

And now this is really the secret of the entire Kaśmīr Śaivism, in this one verse which he quotes from the *Śivasūtravṛtti*. We don't have a book of *Tantraloka* here. We don't have the book of *Śivasūtrāvṛtti* here, but it's in the book. He quotes it here. It is there.

**Page… Page forty-nine in the English translation, and page forty-six in the Sanskrit. It's the same one.**

So I'm just translate, uh, giving my own translation.

> *Duḥkhānyapi sukhānyante viṣāṇyāpyamṛtāyate /
> bhokṣayate saṃsāra yat pathāgacchaṅkaraḥ //*

Where even suffering is transformed into joy, where even poison becomes nectar, where the world itself is a way of liberation. That is the way of *śaṅkaraḥ*, *śaṅkaramārgaḥ*. So this is that whole process, that whole transformation. And it's even… Well, you can call it a transformation, or you can call it something happening simultaneously. It's like in sudden school of Buddhism, you see, *saṃsāra is nirvāṇa*. I mean, it is *mokṣāyate saṃsāraḥ*. So that *saṃsāra* itself is a… is *mokṣa*, is a way to *mokṣa*. And it's not a slow process of transformation or anything, but it is like that. But the one who perceives it like that, who experiences it, has to be an Utpaladeva, or who, uh, as he says, "that noble person who attentively pursues…" See that… But it requires a lot of awareness, a lot of, uh, sensibility to perceive it in that way. 

The path pertaining to *śaṅkaraḥ* means the preeminent expansion of the highest *śakti*, who becomes a means to the attainment of the nature of *śaṅkaraḥ*: *yat pathāgacchaṅkaraḥ*. 

Now, in the commentary, the Sanskrit commentary, uh, on the *Śivasūtravṛtti*, uh, Kṣemarāja interprets *mārgaḥ* as *paraśāktipādam*: The supreme state of energy. It's… So it's not just a path, it's a state. So why does he say this here? Because it was a question of dealing with ordinary, uh, emotional states and experiences which are bound very much to our psychic, uh, physical, uh, psycho-physical, uh, limited existence. 

So the first thing was to recognize that there is something underlying that physical experience, which is… in which it is rooted. That was the first *sūtra*. 

The second *sūtra* says that there is neither pleasure nor pain, nor subject nor object, and, uh, they they do not exist in reality. But that which exists when they are not there, that exists in reality. 

So there is one, um… there is one *tāḍanā* in the *Vijñanabhairava* where somebody… where he says… and what happens when I have to find it… it's rather towards the end… There is something very much connected, you know? Be-… Because we did the *Vijñanabhairava* sometimes, to connect the two texts is very useful. Uh… of course, this connects, uh, verse 136 connects to the previous, uh, *sūtra*. 

> All association with pleasure and pain occurs through the senses. Means we have the *Puryāṣṭaka* here. Therefore detach yourself from the senses and abide within your own self. This is a more simple method concerning the previous one.

And then it… a little advanced one, or deeper one…

> When the mind, the individual consciousness, the vital energy, and the limited ego, these four have disappeared, then the nature of *para* appears. So that is already the negative state of this this *sūtra*.

**When… When I, meaning the… this is 138. But I'm meaning another one. That is what we are trying to do in *Vijñanabhairava*, to do it, uh… That is what we are trying to do all the time, yes.**

**This… how to do that? That's the question.**

I find that also, which, I mean, um… It's kind of like here… There is neither subject nor object, nor pleasure nor pain. And what remains there, that is in reality. And, uh… So you have similar *tāḍanā*, similar meditations in other texts. But of course, *Vijñanabhairava* is very, very fundamental. So now we come…

**So, please… Can please elaborate the last paragraph of the commentary… on the last paragraph? The part pertaining to *śaṅkaraḥ*?**

Yeah. Let us see the Sanskrit: *śaṅkaramārgaḥ*, huh? *śaṅkarātmasvabhāvapr āptihetuḥ paraśakti rūpaprapañcaraḥ*. See? The path of pertaining to *śaṅkaraḥ* means the expansion of the supreme energy: *paraśakti rūpaprapañcaraḥ*, which is a cause of the attainment of the one's own… I would just translate "one's own divine nature": *śaṅkarātmasvabhāvapr āptihetuḥ*. Now the expansion of the supreme *śakti*…

Now *paraśakti*… *parā* is not just an adjective of *śakti*. *Parā* is, uh… the highest, not only manifestation, she is the, uh, supreme, uh, energy. So there are three, uh, levels of *śakti*: *parā*, *parāparā*, and *aparā*. But *parā* is alone… She is the supreme. And, um, that's why this whole tradition of *Parātriṁśikā*, the whole tantra is dedicated to her, not to the other levels, to *parā* only. And she has her own mantra, and she has her own tradition, and that that tradition has been widespread in India, and, uh, Alexander knows a lot about it: *parā*, so the tradition of *parā*. So often, before we knew about these specific traditions, and that we owe to some of the scholars like Sanderson and so on… Uh, we thought it's just an adjective: *paraśakti*. It's not an adjective. It is a… If you want, it's a name. It is her being. She is *parā*. So there is no, uh, uh… It's not an adjective. 

So what happens… I mean, this is very important you ask this question. Because in this whole process… Now we are observing a spiritual process which he, uh, has quoted Utpaladeva to say where this transformation of suffering into, uh, joy and poison into nectar, and this happens in that process. And this process is the *prasāra*, means that expansion of the *paraśakti*, which is a cause… Now the question we are asking again: that she is the cause of the attainment. So without her, there is no attainment of *śaṅkaraḥ*, of one's own divine nature. And that's why he criticizes the Vedāntins, who say that they don't have any *śakti*. So they have only, uh, neutral Brahman, which is totally neutral, and sitting in the absolute, um, motionlessness.

**Yeah, motionlessness. That is *niṣkriya*, *niṣkriya*.**

**The word *napuṃsaka* is used: *napuṃsaka*. Yes. In that… Is that used in a derogatory manner, in that stanza?**

Yeah, this… Yes. *napuṃsaka*, in that… That's right.  This often… the translation is very modern. It doesn't mean… you're correct. It usually is a very modern translation, but you see the guru…  If it's seen in a Derrida tree way, you make a…

**You have to speak louder.**

No, no, no. That's not the problem. It's just a criticism on the Vedanta. This is simple. It's simple that the *napumsaka* actually is the… it, you know… because Brahman doesn't have any activity, basically. 

**The… The meaning is clear.**

Where he is male or female. See, *napuṃsaka* is "it," which is not male and not female.

**Comes at the wrong time.**

So we will try to do verses six and seven so that we, in the afternoon, we can proceed, um, further. Six and seven belong together. 

Now, he has been speaking about *pujyathaka*, which implies the senses and, uh, the mind, intellect, and the ego. And now he comes to the whole question of senses, sense experience. 

> *Yathākāraṇavargoyaṃ vimūḍho amūḍhavatsvayam /
> sahāntareṇa cakreṇa pravṛttiḥ sthitiḥ saṃvṛttiḥ labhate tatprayatnena parīkṣyaṃ tattvam ādarāt //
> yatassvatantratādātsyasarvatraiyam akṛtrimā //*

Now, this, uh, these two verses contain, uh, very, very simple, uh, concept of cosmic terrorism, but still not with the term *spanda*. So because they, uh… when actually was asking why this text is so important… this is the only basic text on this whole school of *spanda* in the whole of Indian philosophy. And still he's so reluctant to use, or to describe the term *spanda*. So this is very significant, because, as in the *Vijnana Bhairava*, we have always stressed, you know, that it's not the philosophy, or the, uh, uh, uh, the definition you have… all this philosophy, you have it. But here, it's a question of experience. And if, in the… at the level of experience, you immediately come with a definition, you know, you first have to live… you have to live the, uh, the *sādhaka*, to to reach that point where that *spanda* can, uh, flash as the, uh, uh… is used always: *spuriti*. It very… flashes. So it's not, um, just to give you a nice definition at the beginning, then you say, "Oh, yes. Now I know what *spanda* is." Uh, you can go home. You don't need the rest of the week here. 

So he is still on the way of letting you through the experience, and the experience means, uh, through our senses, so that the normal, uh, perception, uh, way of perceiving. 

So, let us first, uh, read, uh… I'm sorry, I should read also Mark's translation, um, because the book is so heavy. 

> That principle should be examined with great care and reverence by which this group of senses, though insentient, acts as a sentient force by itself, and along with the inner group of senses goes towards objects, takes pleasure in their maintenance, and withdraws into itself, itself because this natural freedom of it prevails everywhere.

This is not bad as a translation, not bad. He doesn't add things which are not there. 

But let us see what Mark, uh, says: six, seven.

> That principle should be examined with effort and reverence because this, its uncreated freedom, prevails everywhere. By virtue of it, the senses, along with the inner circle, although unconscious, behave as if conscious in themselves and move towards other objects, rest there, and withdraw from them.

So, first of all, we get, um… we are always looking for some practical instructions how to meditate, and so on, but it is full… every verse is full of some practical hints. Only you have to get it. It's not, uh… this is not like a cooking recipe that you do, take this and then you get this, and so on. But you get hints. Everything contains a hint toward practice. Because observing yourself, first of all, your own, uh, states of, uh, mental ups and downs, and all that, which he has done in the previous verses. Now, here it's to observe the senses, what happens with the sense experience. 

And, uh, there is a practice implied: *parīkṣyaṃ tattvam ādarāt*. Examining this reality with respect, with reverence, with, uh… and this is beautiful, because we have a similar expression in the *Vijnana Bhairava*, um, where… I I think it is *pūjā*. The spiritual… *ādarāt*… to observe, or to examine with respect, with, uh, with, uh, reverence. 

*Ādara*, I would like to have some alternative, you know? We are, uh, live in a generation where the word… especially in the West, of course, the word "respect" is, uh, doesn't have a very good, uh, uh, element of… doesn't have a good press. But, uh, *ādarāt*…

One, uh, other… respect, reverence, honor, attention, care, notice, close application, careful effort, eagerness, regard for… It's even earnest desire in the word. And even it means love. Even love. So, uh, "respect" maybe not the word which we like most, but, uh, in that, um… Yeah, it depends on, uh, from what background you come. Once I had one Buddhist woman, and she was so reacting(you remember that *Vijnana Bhairava* seminar?), she said, "No, no, no, we don't want to respect under this," or that. You know, that's, uh… Yeah. No, but reverence, even, love and attention, care. Yeah, all of them. Yeah, this this whole range has to be, um, how do we examine? How do we analyze our own, um, our own experience? Starting from the sense experience. 

And that also has to be examined with great care, with great, um, yeah. And why? Of course, the why comes immediately, because the senses are divine. Yeah. So that that care and that respect is offered to our individual, um, ego-centered, uh, being, but to the divine senses. So that will come here.  

So the the practice: *parīkṣyaṃ tattvam ādarāt*.

Now, the first, uh, statement he makes is that the senses (means the organs themselves) they are insentient. They They don't, uh… the organs, disconnected from from the mind and from their, um, consciousness… They are insentient. But, but it is only… Thank you… when they are along with the inner group… an inner group of senses. *Antareṇa cakreṇa*. *Cakra*, we had the *shakti cakra*. So *shakti cakra*, one of the meanings, is also the, uh, group of senses. They are, um… *pravṛttiḥ* is *sthiti*, uh, *cakreṇa*. *Sahāntareṇa cakreṇa pravṛttiḥ sthitiḥ saṃvṛttiḥ labhate*. Yeah. And this, uh, I didn't complete it. Um, the instruction for, uh, practices… *prayatnena parīkṣyaṃ tattvam ādarāt*. There is effort, and there is respect, and there is, uh, a spirit of an analysis, ana-, analyzing yourself, analyzing what is going on within you when you have some sense experience. Huh? 

**That's the word *parīkṣa*. Yeah, *parīkṣa*, yeah. Examining. Yeah. *Prayatnena*.**

So, I mean, uh, in in… this is also a kind of, uh, uh, meditation of of self-observation, self-analysis. To observe what happens with your sense experience. That, although them, they themselves are not sentient, but they are pushed there, uh, enli-, enlivened by the inner inner *chakra*. *Antareṇa cakreṇa*. *Chakra* of of senses, of the sense divinities.

> *yatassvatantratādātsyasarvatraiyam akṛtrimā* 

So, the processes, um, of going out… I mean, it's a very simple observation: going out, staying there for a moment, and then returning. *Saṃvṛttiḥ*, like *saṃhāra*. That's what we said, that the five acts of Shiva, they are constantly going on, even in our sense perception. There is creating by going out, then establishing by staying, remaining with that object, and then destroying. This *saṃhāra* actually means "withdrawing." It doesn't mean "destroying." You don't don't destroy, uh, the object by taking it in, but it's, uh, taking it in, and, um… so these are the three, uh, basic phases of, um, sense perception. 

**Can you write the five of these… of Shiva's five, five steps? Yeah. I think that is, uh… Yeah. We would want to write those.**

I will write it in the… yes, I will write it. But I think *you* are a Shiva. You should know that.  This is so basic. It's so basic. We are just being introduced. I… I will write it. Yes. 

First one is, uh, this, uh, the senses and, uh, uh, this, um, careful perception, and, uh, withdrawing.

**Is it, uh, that, the, the quality of presence, uh, in every moment, present? Yeah, yeah. Presence. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and also to be aware that it is not the organs which, uh, experiencing, but it is the power behind the organs. And this power is the *karṇeśvarī*. *Karṇeśvarī*s are the *shakti*s of the senses. So, but now,**

Normally, I mean, since, uh, uh… I mean, if if you are not in the spiritual practice, or you are not aware of what is going on, and so on, then you just, uh, you just gone outside, and, uh, you you cannot, uh, reflect on that. But when you are on that part, then you are aware that there is a power behind, and this power is called *Gaṇeśvarī*. This are the the *śakti*s guiding the senses. 

So, where we have to go back, is to the *Gaṇeśvarī*s. 

There is… But see, all the… in all the spiritual traditions they have done, uh, spoken very badly about the senses, because they are the the the… whatever destroys your spiritual part, it's all attributed to the senses. But it's not the senses, if you are aware, and you are aware that these senses are powered… empowered by *śakti*, by power, which is not… which are not your organs… which lies beyond the the organs.

**And yet it's… what causes *māyā*. And yet attachment to the senses is what causes *māyā*. But… but that's what they say.**

If you turn around, you see the whole thing is so… it's the same reality. You only have to make this kind of turn. This is nothing different. You cannot escape the senses, you cannot escape the body. See, the body is also a medium of liberation. That's why *mokṣāya saṃsāraḥ*: the same *saṃsāra* becomes, uh, a way of liberation. The same senses become, uh, a way of enlightenment, but it depends on… I mean, that is your freedom, and that's why he says: *svātantryāt asya*. 

There's misprint in the Sanskrit, that's *svātantryāt asya sarvatra akṛtrimā*, and this is the absolutely… *akṛtrimā* is such a important word… uh, "non-artificial," means natural freedom, absolute freedom. So you are free to turn this whole, uh, circle which draws you down, you know, to make it in the opposite direction. And that is the freedom which is given to you.

**So is there any… it's a thin dividing line between the two. So at what point… I mean, can you define that point in which one becomes the other?**

See, these texts are very, very, um, compact, and, uh, you have to… that's why these commentaries, they make it very explicit, and so on. We can add our own little *masala*, but… but actually, they give us so many hints. How to transform that… the normal… the normal limited consciousness into into that absolute unlimited freedom. *Svātantryāt asya sarvatra akṛtrimā*.

**Which is the sense of this *akṛtrimā*?**

*Akṛtrimā* means "made." Made… *akṛtrimā* is spontaneous… which is not made, not, uh… see, "without effort," um… but "unartificial," of course, is the normal translation, "unartificial" or "natural," but then we translate even *sṛṣṭi* uh by "nature," but implications are different. But *akṛtrimā* means… 

See, our ego, what he has described before, with also this *dṛṣṭāgha*, and so on, it's all artificial, because we ascribe to ourselves that, uh, I'm this body, or I'm this mind, and, uh… the body is not so difficult, but the mind is more difficult. Um… so that is very *kṛtrimā*, uh, um, identification. So…  I… the whole identity which we build up around our individuality, that is all artificial, uh, *kṛtrimā*. See, at the moment when you die, what is there? Your your, um… it's all gone! I mean, this artificially built up, uh, identity. Yeah. So that's why this *akṛtrimā* is very much used, especially in relation to the I-sense, that *aham akṛtrimā*. *Aham* means not that artificially created ego, uh, which is so much bloated up and, uh, increased, and, uh, we know this… we know this… that that the world is existing in that way, but that's why this attempt to come to that source which is free from that artificiality. Yes. 

**Is this an act of free will? Śiva doesn't provide that. Hmm. Is this an act of free will, this artificiality which we build up? Free will? That… it is not an act of free will, this artificiality?**

It is an act of free will, this artificiality? Well… well, of course. 

**Śiva does not provide in this realm.**

And the same way, if it goes… in the verse nine, I'm just going slightly ahead, when you talk about impurities which hinder the thing… are the impurities created by the self? Śiva does not play in that realm.

**Impurity?** 

Yeah, in the verse nine, it talks about impurities which hinder my progress to be the divine. Are the impurities my creation or self-created? 

**Śiva… Śiva… Śiva does not pervade in that, uh, uh, realm?**

Well, this is a very big, um, um, uh, question, you see. When you look at it from the… from the divine point of view, then everything is created by him. Nothing is created by you. Then how can it be a false reality, or an illusion, or anything which we keep talking about every five minutes? But, uh, but see, that freedom… that freedom which, uh, is the divine freedom, it's given to us, and we use it in a very limited and restricted way. So that is our own contribution. See, if we misuse that freedom to…

**I have the freedom to misuse my freedom?**

Well, see, freedom is… freedom is… otherwise, what is the meaning of freedom? 

**No, no, divine in-, intervention happens in my freedom. The divine does not, uh, uh, intervene in any manner in my freedom? Is not my freedom created by the divine?** 

Ultimately, everything is created by the divine. But it is our responsibility to join in that stream of the divine freedom and not to, uh, break away. See, that… the greatest, uh… if you call it "sin" in this tradition, is *bheda*. *Bheda* means "to separate yourself." To to create separation. And that separation is, uh, what we constantly are doing. See, separation between, um, between our, uh, ourselves, human beings, between, uh, everything and anything. So *bheda* is the greatest obstacle. So the the whole aim of this, uh, of this spirituality, of this part, is to reach the state of *abheda*: the integration.

**So am I capable of creating the *bheda*, which is the sin… uh, is the divine responsible for the *bheda* which, uh, pervades in… runs through everything? Is my… I have the divine… if I go by the philosophy which we're reading now. So is the divine, uh, responsible for the sin of creating, uh, *bheda*?**

You see, uh, when we…  everything has its own level of where it… it is meaningful to talk in. If you are at the highest level of your own consciousness and, um… then you can say, "Well, everything is created by the divine." But if you say it from an individualistic point of view, then it is wrong, because that means it takes away your own responsibility. Uh, and I think we have to start from where we are, and where we are, if we are in our limited identity, then we better make an effort to get out of it and not to judge either the divine or the human or anybody else, but to judge our own self. That's why *parīkṣya*: you examine your own self, and then, uh, afterwards, you pass any judgement, if you reach that stage. But you know, it's very easy to, um, discuss these things at the level where they are not really applicable. Uh, and that's why the the texts are also very, very restricted. When you… you was asking about *adhikārabheda*, um… normally, you have to read these texts with a sense, as he said, with respect and reverence, and, uh, a sense of commitment to this spiritual path. And then only you can proceed, and if you proceed, you will find the answers to the questions, which are not just theoretical questions, they are highly practical questions. But unless we proceed and reach a stage of, uh, integration and, uh, liberating us from our, uh, uh, terrible, uh, limitations… And these limitations are… there's a whole system, you know, which I don't want to go into things which are not now in the text… Confuse us. 

See, the same qualities… just a moment… which are divine, like omniscience: *sarvajñatva*. So all the divine qualities, in our individual existence, we have limited them. We know a little bit, and we think that we know everything, but we… we have limited them. That is, uh, with the *rāga*, and attachment. So the divine has a love for the whole universe, and we have attachment to a particular, uh, group of people, and we don't like other people, and so on and so on. So these are the the the limitations of individuality which create the whole trouble, which create that separation. 

So unless we make an effort to overcome these limitations, and to to expand to that consciousness which is all-embracing, and which is total freedom, uh, then we… we cannot judge about things, you know? It's… It's our own responsibility if you think that, uh… who has changed the world. It's a Buddha, it's a Jesus, it is a, uh, Śaṅkara… it's another group. See, the saints who have realized their own true identity, they have changed the world more than any, uh, politician. So it's we who have to change ourselves, and then we can expect to change others, or the world, or the system, whatever you may call it. 

**You see, beautifully you said it, beautifully. Because this question keeps popping up… Yeah… quite often. And this is how it has to be viewed. And you are just simplifying it so beautifully, uh, in a very simple psychological way: that self-observation… the process of self-analysis and self-observation shows that how the different kind of thought forms that we are creating, or interpretations that we're creating, they become the limiting… Yes…  Hmm… uh, uh, things which, uh, impress… which, uh, which constricts the world, and they are unable to see in any different way.**

Yes. So many of these doubts, they… where is the free will operating? Free will is operating everywhere. What we choose… and that is why more and more we open ourselves, the greater chances of changing.

**Yeah. Transforming.**

Yeah. Psychologically I understand.

**Yes. In this manner.**

Yes, absolutely. That's why I mean, self-observation helps you to understand others, what's going on in the minds of others. And, of course, the the greatest… one of the *siddhi*s which is reached… we will come to the *siddhi*s with *bhūti*, uh, in the last chapter, is to read the minds of others. But you can read the minds of others only if you first have understood your own mind and, uh, analyzed, um, what is going on, and what is creating these, uh, limitations and, uh… so this is a process, but, uh… but these *siddhi*s do come, and naturally come. So that will come in the… in the third, uh, third section of, uh, our text. But I think it's better to stop here, and we leave the, uh, commentary for the afternoon session. And, yeah… I think it's time to… Yes. Yes.

**I want you to understand more deeply… Yes, at the moment…**

No, no. It is very essential, this. Yeah. See, this whole criticism which he said about Brahmā being neutral, because he has no, uh, uh, *Shakti*, uh, is the necessity of self-reflection. Now, not in the rationalistic sense, because…  has… is not at all self-reflection in a rational sense, but in a sense of self-awareness, um… that there is this light of consciousness which pervades everything (of course, that is, um), but unless we enter into that state of self-awareness, then only we can become one with that light of consciousness. 

So it's again… it's a process, and of course, is, uh, is *Shakti*, but, um, uh, if that is not sufficient to see this *Shakti*, um, it is, uh… it's the dynamism of consciousness. You see, is static. It's always the same. But is dynamic, and that is why, in the dynamism, we are involved. So all our practice, all our meditation, all our reflection, our study, it's all part of… And, uh… and, um… the more we can connect the study with the meditation and with our self-reflection, the deeper we get into that, um… So I hope that the next days, that will become, uh, clearer in in our own experience. So…

**So what is the etymological root of… in Sanskrit? Etymologically?**

Well, it is mostly used… I think we should switch it on.
