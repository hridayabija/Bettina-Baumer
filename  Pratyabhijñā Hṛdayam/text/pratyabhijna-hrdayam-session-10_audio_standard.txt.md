śāśvatam pañcakṛtyavidhāyine citānandaghaṇasvātma paramārthavibhāsine namaḥ śivāya śāśvatam pañcakṛtyavidhāyine citānandaghaṇasvātma paramārthavibhāsine. 

At the end of the explanation of this sūtra, which speaks of the traces of *samādhi* left even in the waking consciousness, and where the method – if you call it a method – um, for making this *samādhi* or *samāveśa* permanent is *kāmāmudrā*. At the end, he comes, uh, to the meaning of this *kāmāmudrā*. 

Making it permanent, making this experience permanent, requires precisely an integration of the inner with the outer, of the outer with the inner. But this is already – and he stresses again and again – *paramayogin*, only for the *yogin* of the higher, um, highest *yogin*. The beginner cannot practice this and cannot experience this. It is for advanced. That is why it's – unless you have already experienced *samādhi* or *samāveśa*, this practice cannot happen. 

Either it happens spontaneously. This is the best. In this whole tradition, spontaneity is always the best. You can, uh, practice something, make an effort, but that is always of a lower, lower level. That's why when you are reading this text, and many of this concept seem to be, uh, at first sight difficult and so on. But then when something strikes a chord, and then something gets triggered, some experience gets triggered, and you enter into that spontaneous realization. That is much better than if you make up your mind: now I have to practice this, and this, and this. This making up one's mind is of the lowest, uh, level. And spontaneity is what corresponds to, uh, *prativījña*, because it is unexpected. 

And that is why *prativījña*, on the other side, is, uh, corresponded by *śaktipāta*. So *śaktipāta* is again something which happens suddenly, which you have no control of, but which is both the condition and the and the effect of your state of consciousness. It is that which triggers the experience and also which, um, yeah, which makes it possible. So *śaktipāta* is not in anybody's control. And that is why, um, Abhinavagupta explains it with two words: one is not undeserved and, um, what is this? Undeserved and unexpected. 

So that is the sign of *śaktipāta*. You can't deserve it. And, and yet you can be open to it; you can be, uh… But it's not, not the question – even people who are searching, who are practicing *yoga*, and this and that, there is no guarantee. That there is no, um, certificate issued that now you have to get *śaktipāta*. 

So that is why spontaneity. And we have seen from the very first sūtra that the importance of *svātantrya*, freedom. And I also translate *svātantrya* sometimes as spontaneity. Something which happens without any cause. That is a sign of freedom, of independence, of that *śakti*, that divine energy which is operating. Whatever we have done, it's all *śakti* who is operating. 

So now we are on page 104 and 105. I think we have done this:

> samāviṣṭa sākṣātkṛtaparāśakti sphāra sādhakaḥ paramayogin bhavati

That we have done. 

> Atra ca bāhyāt abi abhyantarāt viṣayagrāhmāt antaḥ parasyaṃ citibhūmau grasanakrameṇa eva praveśaḥ samāveśo bhavati

So there are two, uh, words used which are again – they have a very physical, uh, association. Uh, one is *grasanā*. *grasanā* means swallowing, and the other is *vāmana*, which means spitting out. So swallowing means integrating the outside within, *grasanā*, *grasa*. That is why one of the, uh, practices is to overcome time, *kāla*. Time is the greatest obstacle – not space, time. And that practice is called *kālagrasa*, swallowing of time. And there is a goddess *kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*. But *saṃkarṣa* is a different image. 

But *grasa* – this swallowing means, uh, absorbing, um, the external in the interior. So bāhyāt grasyamānāt by the *sādhaka*, the, uh, the *yogin* of the highest type, becomes *samāviṣṭa*. That we have already done. From external, by swallowing that external, um, which consists of a collection of objects, *viṣayagrāhmāt*, and bringing it within. In, in the stage of the supreme consciousness, *parasyaṃ citibhūmau*. By the process of *grasanā*, of absorbing. And entering in this way from the outside to the inside, *praveśa*. It becomes his state of absorption, *grasanakrameṇa*. 

And the opposite process is:

> abhyantarāt citiśakti svarūpācca sākṣātkṛtāt āveśavaśāt samāveśasamarthyaṃ iva bāhyasvarūpe idanta etc. etc. 

From the external experience, *citiśakti svarūpāt*… No, sorry, sorry. 

> Abhyantarāt

From the internal. From the nature of the power of consciousness, *citiśakti svarūpāt*. Having experienced that, by the power of, by the power of absorption, *āveśavaśāt*… 

Let us read the other thing. In this process – penetration of the inner, uh, totality of external sense object, this we have already done – into the internal, into the highest plane of consciousness. Penetration into the inner also *samāveśa* by the very process of assimilation, so *grasanā*. Again there occurs through the internal – this through the realization of the nature of *citiśakti* by the power of *samāveśa*, um – absorption, a penetration, or entrance into the external. That is, into the totality of sense objects appearing as this. 

So there are always these two poles: *aham* and *idam*. Subject and object, *aham* and *idam*. So the integration of *aham* and *idam*, of subjectivity and objectivity – this is what happens in *kāmāmudrā*. And this process is called *vāmanayukti*. The process of projecting outside, or, uh, what does he say? Project- externalization, yeah. That is, uh, projecting outside from within.

And then comes – very important – coming back to what we had, um, before in a more theoretical con- context. And here, it's a practical experience. When you go through this process of externalization, internalization, what you experience is precisely that *samāveśa*, that state of absorption which is an experience of the crystallization of consciousness: 

> citrasa asyānatāḥ prathanātmā samāveśaḥ

So this is not an abstract concept, it is an experience that when you look at the flower, or you look at anything, when you are in that process of having already internalized the external and externalized the internal, then the objects start to reveal their inner nature, which is the nature of consciousness, *citrasa*. 

So, like the scientist also requires a lot of intuition to – it's not just only experimentation, but an intuitive understanding of the nature of reality. And many scientists say the first, first starting point was intuition. Whether it's Einstein, or Heisenberg, or… But then you, you prove it, and you establish it, and you… 

So the same thing in spirituality. You have an idea, you have a concept, and then when you practice, and then you realize it by experience. 

So this:

> citrasa asyānatāḥ prathanātmā samāveśaḥ

So that you can… Yes, in *yoga* they would call spontaneous *saṃyama* of these objects. Yes, that yes, yes. But this is a peculiar concept of here, this *citrasa asyānatāḥ*. This solidification of, of consciousness in, in the objects. 

> Iti sa bāhyābhyantarāyānnityoditasamāveśātmā mudho

Now he explains what is *mudrā*. This, um, ever-arising, or ever-present, uh, state of absorption which integrates the external and the internal – *sabāhyābhyantarā* – is *mudrā*. *Mudrā* means happiness. 

So this is a traditional etymology of the *tantras* of *mudrā*, um, analyzing it between, uh, *mudan rāti dadāti iti mudrā*. So *mudā* is joy. So *mudrā* is always an expression of, of inner fullness, an expression of joy. It, it cannot be the opposite. *Mudrā* is, uh, *Haṛṣa*. 

> Haṛṣasya Vitaranāt

By the expansion, or the, uh, of joy, happiness.

> Parama paramānandasvarūpatvāt 

Because it is of the nature of supreme bliss. And then the other comp- uh, com- uh, part of *Mudrā*, uh, *Mudrā*, *Mud-* *Mud-* and *Drā*. Now *Drā* they derived it from the verbal root *drāvayati*, to dissolve. 

> bāṣa bā- bāṣadrāvanāt

Because it bestows happiness and it dissolves the bonds. It is the – it leads to dissolution of bonds. *Drāvanāt* is again a liquefication, it's a dissolution, uh, making it liquid… From this bonds, it says so solid.

> Viśvasya antaḥ turīyasthitayām Mud- Mudranāt ca Mudrātmatvāt 

So it's of the nature of *Mudrā*. And I would not translate this “gesture,” but this attitude which, because it, it – it seals the whole universe, *Viśvasya antaḥ*, within it the whole universe within, in the state of the fourth state of consciousness, *turīyasthitayām*. And that is why this *Mudrā* – *Mudrā* is something which stamps, which seals, which leaves a, a strong impression… Page 106, grammar. 

So this, uh, grammar. *Mudrā* consists of this two words, and grammar means process or, um, sequence, or… but process I would say. 

How does this succession also…

> Krama abhiḥ sṛṣṭyādikrama āpāsakatvāt Tad Krama āpāsa rūpatvācca krama

It is called succession because it, um, is of the nature of a succession of appearance. So it's not only space, but also time. And that sequence is, of course, again, uh, *sṛṣṭi* etc., creation, all these five acts which we had – the appearance, or the manifestation, of this, uh, sequence of those acts. And this is the sequence. 

So which means again this grammar *Mudrā* is a, an integration of the macrocosm with the microcosm. It is the practical way what he said before: *Viśvamātmasātkarotīti*, to assimilate the universe in the body, in one's own self. And this assimilation is, uh, happens in the grammar *Mudrā*. 

Now we come to the last sūtra, and, uh, it all depends on your capacity to, um, whether you're still ready to listen, uh, otherwise we can also conclude it tomorrow morning. Yeah, it's very long. Long sūtra, and it tries to pack into this sūtra whatever is left out before. So that's why it is very condensed. 

I write it separating the words; otherwise, it's very long, um… So the introduction to this sūtra says:

> Now he states – he means, “I state” – the fruit of the attainment of *samādhi*. What is the fruit?

So this, uh, I still remember Jaggi saying, you know – I have known him very closely – and when he was working on those texts, sometimes I would meet him, say, "Oh Kṣemarāja compounds, you know, they're like long snakes, and they have to…" – endless compounds. 

So here he puts a very long compound in this last sūtra. So what is the fruit of attaining this *samādhi*? The *samādhi* which is the result of *Krama Mudrā*, not the previous *samādhi*, which was a limited one. 

Uh, those who know Sanskrit know that you have to dissolve a compound always from the end. 

> Cakreśvaratāprāptirbhavatīti

He attains *prāpti*, the attainment of the lordship over the cycle of energies. We have heard this sūtra – to the… unfortunately, I didn't give you a translation – to the deities of the senses, um, which was the *Dehasthadevatā cakra*. That's a *cakra* sūtra, uh, means all the sense organs, which are goddesses, which are deities. And *śivā*, or the, is the *cakreśvara*. He is the Lord of this wheel of energies. So *śakti cakra* is all our sense organs, and then in the universe, microcosmic, macrocosmic, and so on. And *śivā* is *cakreśvara*. He is the Lord of the wheel of energies. And the yogī who has attained to this state, he also attains the status of *cakreśvara*, the Lord over the cycle of energies. So this is the highest state. 

Because all we have seen in the previous sūtras, all the activities and everything, is operated by *śakti*. By *śaktis*, both positive and negative, because also *śaktis* are also deluding powers, or our own, um, energies deluding us. So they have both this aspect: deluding and liberating. 

But he is the Lord over this cycle of energies, *śakti cakra*. Now we have to analyze it. 

> Prakāśānandasāram ahāmantavīryātmaka pūrṇahaṃtā āveśātma sadā sarvasargasamhāraka- samhārakāri nityasaṃviddevatā cakreśvaratāprāptir

Now he is the *cakreśvara*, he is the Lord over which powers? Over the powers of one's own consciousness, *nityasaṃviddevatā*. The power, the, the deities who are the deities of our own consciousness. 

> Nityasaṃviddevatā cakreśvaratā 

The lordship over the deities of our own consciousness. 

> Which sadā… 

Which are always…

> …sarvasargasamhārakāri… 

…which always bring about creation and reabsorption. Now here *sarga* and *saṃhāra* just given us the two extremes of this five acts. 

> …There ever… This saṃviddevatās, they're always bringing forth creation and again reabsorption, *sarga* and *saṃhāra*. And this lordship – maheśvaratā, cakreśvaratā – consists in, um… pūrṇahaṃtā āveśa… No, āveśāt, by… 

So this is an ablative. By, by, by being absorbed, by entering, by, um, yeah, entering into the state of fullness of I-consciousness, *pūrṇahaṃtā*. Which is where all individual consciousness is dissolved into that fullness, *pūrṇahaṃtā*, of I-consciousness. 

> Pūrṇahaṃtā āveśāt

By entering into the fullness of I-consciousness.

> And… And this fullness of I-consciousness consists in the virility, the power of the great *mantra*, *mahā mantra vīrya*. Which is whose essence is light and bliss. Now you go from the last to the first: Prakāśānandasāra, whose essence is light and bliss.

So I'm not reading – now we can read Jaggi, if you think – but it's good to know how to analyze. 

Then, as a result of entering into the perfect I-consciousness, which is in essence *cit ānanda*… Oh, it is not *cit*, it is *prakāśa*, like… It, of course, light is the light of consciousness, but deliberately says *prakāśa*, ah, light and conscious… light and bliss, and of the nature of the power of great *mantra* there, *tattvam*. This being so, it is *Shivaṃ* – is all this is in reality the form of *Shiva*, this is the conclusion. So he has only paraphrased the, the *sūtra*, or explained it by alternative, uh, synonyms, etc. 

This being so, the essence of whatever is cognized is cognition of this – again, the inwardly turned experience, or the, uh, interiorized and experience full of self-consciousness – are the essential truth, *tattvam*, *antaḥmokavimarśamayā pramātṛtattvaṃ*. So the whole of objectivity has to be merged in the ultimate subjectivity, which is the divine subject, which is only one. 

> deśān api vikalita dehādi upādhi saṃkoca abhimānā'śeṣa śarīrā sadā śiveśvaratā iva sarvam 

And this, this subject, which has given up the false identification, or… with a false identification with the body, etc., has been dissolved, *vikalita*. And whose body is the whole universe: *aśeṣa śarīra sadā śiveśvaratā iti sarvam*. This is the essence. I would suggest that we, uh, finished this commentary tomorrow, uh, because it's very dense, and it's not…
