नमः शिवाय शततम्। पञ्चकृत्यविधानें चितानन्दघनस्वात्मन्, रमार्तिविधातसि नमः। शिवाय शततम्। 

## Introduction

I pay my homage to that wonderful speech of my guru which is like a boat for crossing the fathomless ocean of doubt and is full of words which yield wonderful meaning.

We had another ocean in the morning, that was the ocean of the the deep ocean of the the knowledge of uh of Śivajñāna, of the knowledge of Śiva. But that's a positive ocean in which all the rivers of uh knowledge uh find rest. 

But there is another ocean, that's the ocean of doubt, uh *saṃśayāmbudhi*. And uh it is the guru's speech, guru's word which carries one across that ocean of doubt. So I'm um asking you to be uh be a bit patient with the text. In the beginning it looks a bit difficult and um but then uh it will carry us uh Kṣemarāja will carry us to great uh depths of experience. 

## The Ideal of Pratyabhijñā and the Question of Enlightenment

But he proceeds um also very pedagogically from the negative to the positive. We say that uh the ideal of Pratyabhijñā is sudden um sudden awakening or sudden enli- enlightenment. And then the question, why this so complicated uh explanations and so complicated steps and so on? But the purpose is precisely to um to answer the question, why are we not enlightened? So what is the uh limitation or what are the limitations which prevent us from that sudden awakening? 

And there he goes step by step through the um understanding of the limited being starting from the universal uh from the cosmic um which we have seen, that is the *Viśva-citi-hetu*, that universal consciousness which is the cause of the accomplishment of the universe. And there are different meanings then given to this and I I will not go into too great detail. But uh some of these meanings um have to be looked at. Śiva is the cosmic the cosmic and then.

## The Argument for Pure Consciousness as the Cause of the Universe

So the last um argument was that um there is no other cause for the universe which is not this uh pure consciousness and which is complete freedom. Because anything, whether Māyā or Prakṛti, they are also dependent on that consciousness. Neither Māyā nor Prakṛti in the different systems uh of thought can uh be the cause of uh of the universe because they also depend on this uh consciousness. Consciousness means always light, *Prakāśa*. And without that light nothing would exist at all, this is the um argument of the Pratyabhijñā. So um it's on page 48 in the text. 

## An Objection and its Reply

Then um there is an objection. If everything is consciousness, is not the universe then um non-existent? This is everything is consciousness, so there's the question of cause and effect and so on. 

And then he replies: *"cit eva bhagavatī svaccha-svatantra-rūpā tat tat ananta jagat-ātmanā sphurati"* It is the great lady, great goddess consciousness alone who is of the form of pure independence, pure freedom, such as *vatantra-rūpā*, and which shines or which uh manifests or shines as infinite worlds.

## The Concept of Infinite Worlds in Śaiva Cosmology

There's something also interesting in the Śaiva cosmology um they always speak of uh an infinity of worlds. If you think of modern cosmology or modern uh physics you know, they did not think of only one world. And they uh of course traditionally number of worlds is 118, I cannot tell you why 118 but there is definitely a reason. But sometimes also infinite worlds. So that awareness that this universe is not just limited to our world or to our earth, the infinite worlds. So this uh very independent goddess consciousness shines in the form of this infinite world, so there's nothing is left out. Nothing is outside it. And uh Yeah the question is Yeah this was the question. So there's no question of any causal relation of uh relation of cause and effect, because it's the same consciousness which is both cause and effect.

## The Limitations of Proof and Rational Thought

And then he says, there are very nice expressions. He says, what can this uh poor means of proof, proof *pramāṇa* (see the whole logic um system of logic depends on the means of proof or means of right uh knowledge, *pramāṇa*. But he says, what can this poor fellow uh means of proof do in relationship to this uh absolute consciousness? Because the means of proof is there to prove something which is not yet known. Which is not uh to bring to light new objects. And this means of proof is neither fit nor qualified to prove the ultimate consciousness which is ever present and which is the very basis of knowledge and the very basis of um even this uh means of proof. This uh *pramāṇāvarāka upayuktam upapānam*. So what is the use of this means of proof in relation to this pure consciousness?

## The Simile of the Shadow and the Head

And there is one uh simile which Kṣemarāja loves to quote in different texts. It's uh from a Tantra, *Trikaśāra*. And uh the simile says: *"svapadanā svapṛṣṭha- svaśiraś-chāyām"* It's on page 49. If one tries to cross um to jump over the shadow of one's head with one's own foot, the foot will never be there where the head is, where the shadow of the head is. And in in the same way, this uh means the uh rational thought or the mind can never um attain that *bindavikalana*. What is this *bindavikalana*? *Bindavikalana* is um is that um pure uh consciousness which is concentrated in a point. This of course, this a Tantric expression uh. What is this uh *bindavikalana*? Yeah, just as when a person desires to step on the shadow of his own head with his foot, his head will never be on the place of his foot. Likewise this dynamism of the *bindu*. Now *bindu* is that concentrated energy which uh cannot be objectified. That means your thought or your rational mind can never reach that or can never uh reach that point which uh you cannot uh attain by by thought or by by arguments uh. He just loves this uh simile. 

## The Concept of Samarasya and the Dynamic Power of Śiva and Śakti

And then for uh for the nine *alothana*: *"yat tat īham viśva-sṛṣṭi-hetuḥ para-advaya-samarasya āpādana ātmani ca saṃhāra-hetuḥ"*. Since this consciousness is the cause of the city of the universe as well as of *saṃhāra*, which consists in bringing about *samarasya* or identity with the highest non-dual consciousness, therefore it is called free will, *svātantrya*. Now *samarasya* is another beautiful and very dynamic term. The Śivites were very fond of uh dynamic terms. And that is why the whole expression was *svātantrya*, that independence, that freedom. And um it's always the *Śakti* which um is uh expressed in in dynamic terms. And *samarasya* is the fusion of essences. It's a term for unification or unity or uh union of two essences. *Rasa* is of course a fluid, something fluid and also something blissful. And the ultimate *samarasya* is between Śiva and *Śakti*. That is the flowing together, the union, the um uh one essence um of the two, Śiva and *Śakti*, that is *samarasya*. And this supreme non-duality is not something static, but it is precisely that flowing together and that dynamic power uh with the uh between Śiva and *Śakti*. 

## The Recognition of Freedom and its Consequences

And then he comes finally: *"pratyabhijñātā svātantryasati"*. When this um freedom is recognized here *pratyabhijñā* comes, that the name of the whole system *Pratyabhijñātā*. If this freedom is recognized (Means recognition means in your own self) then *"bhoga-mokṣa-sva-rūpānāṃ viśva-sṛṣṭīnām hetuḥ"*. It becomes the cause of all perfections consisting of *bhoga* and *mokṣa* (means um powers and liberation uh uh yeah *bhoga* how to translate? It's not enjoyment is not the right translation. But uh powers and and liberation). So if this independence, if this complete freedom of this consciousness is recognized, then it becomes the cause of attaining both *bhoga* and *mokṣa*. That's a *hetu*.

## The Universe and its Constituents

Then uh the last paragraph page 49. Sorry. Yeah we have in the morning we have spoken about *samādhi* that is it is precisely in the positive sense uh which uh brings about the state of uh unifusion uh fusion which with consciousness. Now um the universe or the external um experiences are traditionally described in the way in in which uh it gives here that the universe *viśva* means *nīlasukhadehaprāṇādi*. That means blue blue is always given as an example for external perception. You look at the sky now, just now it's not blue, but mostly it is blue. Um external perception, sense organs, *sukha* means happiness, means internal uh emotions. You're happy, you're sad or something. But these are also objective. They are not uh pure subjectivity. They they maybe be internal but they are not uh they are also belong to the objective field. The body, the vital breath, *prāṇa*, etcetera. So what does this etcetera refer to uh the body, the vital breath, *prāṇa*, and the internal organs like mind, *bud*, uh intellect, uh ego. They are contained in this *prāṇādi*. So all this constitutes the universe. External perceptions, internal uh feelings uh body uh mind, etcetera, etcetera. All this is the universe. And *tasya āt city* here. And it's perfection or it's accomplishment by a gradual um gradual arising, *āroha*, by gradual ascent *vimarshamāyāpramātryāveśa*. In the morning we have spoken about *samāveśa*. *Āveśa* is the same only *samāveśa* gives it more power, but it means again this complete entering or pervasion or merging in the divine. So what is happening here is *vimarshamāyāpramātryāveśa*. The pervasion or the merging of the entering into the pure subject which is which is consist of an awareness. So *āveśa* can also be translated by introversion, by an awareness of the process of introversion, *vimarsha* awareness. *Māyā* means consisting of awareness and awareness of *pramātryāveśa* means in internalization in the subject. So uh this It sounds very um abstract but it can be absolutely practiced. 

## The Practice of Introversion

So what is the practice? The practice would be this: observing all the phenomena, the experiences, whether sense experience or internal feelings, as with an awareness um of introverting these experiences. Now this is uh it is very brief here, *sādhakahētu* and this is the cause. Here in the cause of spiritual uh experience, *parijñāna upayasya*. So then this becomes the means. See *hetu* here means a spiritual means, *upaya*. So this becomes the means of recognition of knowledge, *parijñāna*. Again the ascent, *āroha*. The ascent of everything such as blue, joy, body, *prāṇa*, etcetera simply by observing how these are flowing into the awareness and to be aware or to intro- by an introverted act of awareness, *vimarshamāyāpramātryāveśa*. And this Of course these are practices if we are doing again once again the *Vijñānabhairava* which we have already done twice. There are many examples in the *Vijñānabhairava* of such processes where any sense perception can lead you to that introverted state. And um it becomes a means of achieving that *city*. That uh uh perfection or that experience. So he comes down from the cosmic meaning of *viśva* and *hetu* to the spiritual meaning of *hetu* as the *upaya*, as the means of entry into that divine consciousness. 

## The Vijñānabhairava Verse 106 and the Importance of Awareness

And then um he brings Of course I've already mentioned the *Vijñānabhairava* so immediately he quotes it: *"Anena ca sukopayatam uktam"*. And it has been said already in the beginning that this is an easy means (easy in the sense of no need of very uh reciting lakhs of mantras or doing lakhs of prostrations or any kind of uh complex ritual etcetera etcetera). *Sukhopaya*, an easy means. And then he quotes the *Vijñāna*. Can you give me the *Vijñānabhairava*, *Vijñānabhairava* verse 100? Thank you 106. And this is a verse which seems so simple but it is not at all simple. It's quite um it implies quite a lot. *"Grāhyagrāhaka samvittiḥ samānyā sarvadehinām yoginām tu viśeṣho'sti sambandhe sarvadānatā"* Um. The perception of object and subject is common to all embodied beings, not only to human beings. Every ant knows where to go to a piece of sugar or uh any a butterfly knows where to go to flower etcetera. So subject and object is common to all. But characteristic of yogis is that they are constantly aware of this relationship. So this awareness is something very very powerful. And this awareness means also an awareness of the unity of subject and object. Both of the distinction and of the unity. But there's a lot of um there are a lot of commentaries on this. Unfortunately Kṣemarāja's commentary on the *Vijñānabhairava* has not been preserved. But um the whole practice is one of awareness. So and why he quotes it precisely at this point where the question of external perceptions, sense perceptions, internal body feeling this and that and so on. So all of these which are our common worldly experiences, if we are in that state of awareness, they can become a means of *āveśa*, means of entry into that divine consciousness. That's just the Of course Swami Ji says um the knowledge and the mode of knowledge of the objective world and the subjective world is the same in each and every being. Only there is one exception in yogis, in realized souls, that the contact of objectivity and subjectivity is different in them, it is divine. Because they remain fully aware in each and every act of the daily routine of life. This is This is the the secret. It sounds very simple, but to practice it is uh requires a very refined and highly developed uh awareness. 

## Summary of the Commentary on the First Sūtra

So then he summarizes the commentary on the first sūtra um *city* um. Why he explains why the word *city* (consciousness) is used in the singular. And he says because um it goes against all pluralism, all uh doctrines of pluralism. So that I mean if it goes against the pluralistic doctrines, that means the Shaiva Siddhānta where in Shaiva Siddhānta you have a uh infinite number of souls which are separate from each other uh and so on. So this is pluralistic doctrine. And *"svatantra svatantra śabda brahmavādavैलक्षण्यम् ācakṣaṇam"*. By the word *svatantra* means free um it is stated that it is different from the *brahmavadins* (means from Vedānta). Because in Vedānta Brahman has no freedom to act. It is *niṣkriya*. And whereas the uh Shiva of the non-dualist Shaivism is um fully dynamic and fully uh with his uh *śaktis* absolutely free. And *viśva* (universe or totality) means *śeṣaśaktitvam*, the totality of energies. So this he has not developed it before, but the universe is actually it consists of a totality of energies. The universe is nothing but divine energies, *śaktis*. See every aspect of the universe is an aspect of *śakti*, but only one has to recognize it. And because it is the cause of everything, *sarvakāraṇatvam*, it is the easy means and it brings a great fruit, that means liberation. So this is He summarizes the first um commentary on the first sūtra. 

## Introduction to the Second Sūtra

Now introduction to the second sūtra. You will see that it's the style of uh the style of the Indian um authors and commentators that you you have a sūtra, then you comment and then you you make a connection or uh raise a question to uh lead onto the next sūtra and uh so he does it himself because he is also the author of the sūtra and the author of the commentary. So the introduction to the second sūtra: *"Nanu viśvasya yadi city hētu tat asya upādāna ādi apekṣaṇam apekṣayām vedavāda vedavādāparityāgaḥ syāt iti āśaṅkyāha"*. So this is a question related to different systems of Indian philosophy that if there is the um universe is brought about um by this absolute consciousness, it needs a material cause. It needs something something to bring about this *sṛṣṭi*.

## The Second Sūtra and the Power of Will

So and then the the second sūtra answers: *"Sveccayā svapittau viśvam unmīlayati"*. Out of its own He wants to go on because she, this feminine as we have seen she is the great goddess, of out of her own will, her own power of will. It was she manifests the universe on the screen of her own self. And this is there something very interesting. I mean this is an image which is used again and again uh for the nonduality of consciousness, that you are not The manifestation is not something outside, but it is manifested on the same the same consciousness um which acts like a screen or like a uh canvas on which this multiform being of the universe is projected. It's very interesting for those of you who know Ramana Maharshi. Ramana Maharshi used the image of film, that you have a a plain white uh screen on which the images are projected, which is of course much more useful but at the time of Jñānadeva there was no no cinema, but uh so he had to use the image of the fresco or of a a picture. But the cinema is much better because it is dynamic. This uh it is dynamic. And without that plain white screen uh that would not be visible, that image. But here they use this uh *bhitti* means um a wall where a fresco is painted and so on. So and that wall and the painting and everything is the same consciousness. It is not any other external agent or object um which is um because. And that out of her own *icchā*. Now *icchā* we have seen that *svātantrya* was in the first sūtra which is the overall power of Śiva, *Svātantryaśakti*, his absolute power of independence and autonomy. But this power of independence manifests as will. *Icchā* is the first manifestation of in the process of uh manifestation. The first is the arising of will or a desire to create or whatever. And so these three uh *śaktis*: *icchā*, *jñāna*, *kriyā*, which I said in the morning they are not only of Śiva they are our own *śaktis* also, only in a limited way. Before you um know anything, before you act, there is an a a moment of of will, of uh a desire to know, a desire to act and then it manifests down from *icchā* to *jñāna* to *kriyā*. So this *svātantrya*, this pure independence, pure freedom first um manifests as as will. 

Now as I said in the morning, all these translations are not satisfactory because um all these terms, I mean whether it's consciousness or will or uh they are so much um influenced by Western um conceptions. And will is also mostly understood as individual, not this the will of an individual. But here uh *icchā* is something much more primordial. That's why I mean this Sanderson he translates it uh as the uh primordial impulse or something. It is it is not the will you know. The moment will you you are doing it with your mind. *Icchā* has not to do with the mind. It's it's that impulse, that arising, but it's no negative, no positive. It's just neutral. Just that power of impulse which then makes you think and do and and so on. So *svecchayā*, by her own will, by her own inner impulse. Now this is a very short um commentary because um it is not So by the power of her will alone she unfolds the universe upon her own screen. So it's just to negate um any other theory of um material cause. There are different theories in Indian philosophies of the creation uh material cause, *upādāna kāraṇa* and and and so on um. 

## The Simile of the City in the Mirror

So this which is based on a duality of course. But here we are in a nondual um uh understanding of reality. There is no need of any material cause. Even that material cause if it was the cause uh they would say is again the same consciousness. So that the question of duality does not arise. But it's uh beautifully expressed: *"prakṛyā nityam viśvam darpaṇe nagaravad bhinnam api bhinnam api unmilayati"* Um. And this is a very commonly used simile in Kashmir Śaivism: like a city in a mirror. Imagine what a big mirror must have been there at that time to reflect the whole city, *darpaṇe nagaravat*. So like a city in a mirror which it is both uh separate and non-separate. It is uh It looks um separate but it is not separate. *"bhinnam api"* um *"abhinnam api"* *"bhinnam unmilayati"*. So this um uh This image of the city in the mirror uh is very common. Uh Of course it has far-reaching philosophical consequences which I'm not going into now. But it is a method of maintaining the uh nonduality of manifestation in that consciousness. The manifestation is there. It looks as if it is different but ultimately it is not different because it is only a reflection in the mirror of consciousness. *unmilayati*, with manifests it unfolds. Yeah. It is all this image you know of *unmīlana, nimīlana*. Uh it has to do with the opening and closing of the eyes. So uh what we had before *un- unmeṣa, nimeṣa* also *unmīlana, nimīlana* as we have also two kinds of *samādhi*. One is with closed eyes um *nimīlana samādhi* and one is with open eyes, *unmīlana samādhi*. But it also means when you open the eyes that manifestation appears. 

## The Third Sūtra and the Levels of Consciousness

And now this sūtra three um is uh rather complex, but we'll try to uh summarize it without going too much into the uh details. It's very interesting but um I think we we may not have the time. See the question how he proceeds. He proceeds from multiplicity to unity. From the perception of multiplicity and um to the experience of recognition as uh unity. So the question arises: From where comes this multiplicity? *"tannānā anurūpa grāhya grāhaka pratyayat"*. See this multiplicity uh in the world, worldly multiplicity. It consists in a corresponding relationship between subjects and objects. And this corresponding um it is then put in the context of different levels of perceivers. These are different levels of consciousness. It's um not all beings not even human beings are at the same level of consciousness. And there are traditionally in the Śaiva um scriptures seven such levels are distinguished. And they sound a bit mythological, but in the in this uh Advaita tradition they are brought down to uh the levels of consciousness which we ourselves can experience or we can go through. And uh so he describes so that universe is manifold because of the differentiation of reciprocally correlated (I would say instead of adapted) objects and subjects. And there are seven such grades or levels of um subjects with their respective objects. And I think it's very easy even if we observe you know Suppose you look at a child um the kind of objects the child relates to or uh different uh people at different levels of consciousness, their that subject object relationship depends on their level of consciousness. And here it is in a kind of mythologized uh way, but um it is a very important uh this um levels of awareness, levels of consciousness. 

## The Tattvas and the Hierarchy of Consciousness

Now they are equated also with you have the list of *tattvas* uh. These levels of consciousness are equated actually the *tattvas*. The higher *tattvas* are also corresponding to uh levels of consciousness. And that goes down from it's Sadāśiva down um through different levels: īśvara, *sadvidyā*, *māyā* etc. So he goes to all these uh levels of consciousness and here something um important to understand. Our ordinary state of consciousness is called *sakala*. So when we are just at this level you know, we are uh subject and object. We perceive different objects and this uh everything is separate. And uh and we perceive the uh the other people are separate. We perceive uh everything as separate from us. That is called the the consciousness of *sakala*. So somebody who has not done any yoga or any meditation or any uh effort to rise above this uh uh level of um just um pluralistic awareness you know Everything is uh everything is separate. That's called *sakala*. 

And there is one root or a part of this um names *kala*. There is a chapter in this this book of Swami Lakshman Joo, Kashmir Śaivism. He has seven states of the seven perceivers um where he makes it uh very clear, but uh we cannot go Well he has two chapters on the seven perceivers. *Sakala* state is that state when perception takes place in the objective world and not in the subjective world. And so on. And then there is one uh state, *pralayākala*. It is a state of consciousness or kind of unconsciousness which happens when uh suppose you are uh in a coma or you're even in a in a false kind of *samādhi*. There are uh among yogis there are kinds of *samādhi* which are not leading to awakening but just to uh to losing consciousness. And they can be at that state of *pralayākala* means you are devoid of uh uh consciousness because you are *pralaya* that that you are it is in a state of dissolution. And which of course happens at the uh the at the cosmic *pralaya* when all the beings are um merged in a state of uh dissolution and uh they they are not completely gone, but their consciousness is completely uh submerged or completely how this is said properly. And then. The state of unawareness. Yeah. So it's a a hierarchy of um different states of consciousness which are identified with certain levels of the *tattvas* and certain uh perceivers which uh have uh names like uh *Mantra-maheśvara*. At the highest level *Mantra-īśvara*. *Mantra* (*Mantra* not as the word mantra but as beings. Mantras are also beings. Um spiritual beings). So there are different um different levels of um consciousness. 

## The Levels of Māyā and Śuddha-Vidyā

And at a stage of *māyā*. When you come down the levels of the *tattvas*, if you look at your scale, *Māyā* is that level. It's not the Vedāntic *Māyā* but the *Māyā* in the Śaiva cosmology which is the limit where the the the limited perception ends and there is a the possibility of entering into *śuddha-vidyā*, that is pure wisdom, where you overcome those uh limitations of *māyā*. Now at the level of *Māyā*. At the stage of *Māyā* there is *śūnya-brahmāṇḍa*. *Śūnya-brahmāṇḍa* does not mean the highest *śūnya* of the Buddhists. But it means uh a state of void um again a state of unconsciousness. They're called *śūnya-brahmāṇḍa*. Whose field of experience practically consists of the insensible, which is quite appropriate to their state. And so we we are I mean uh basically we are *sakalas* because we are uh conscious of the plurality. We are uh conscious of difference and so on. So when looked at hierarchically one can ascend through all these stages. And that of course Abhinavagupta Abhinavagupta has inherited from the Śaiva scriptures, that he has not invented. So he has to also deal with all these hierarchies which are there in the Tantras. Um and then he gives it a non-dualistic interpretation.

## The Non-Dualistic Interpretation and the Transcendent Paramaśiva

But we come to the end where he comes back to his non-dualistic interpretation. Uh let me just read the uh page 54. That *"uttīrṇa-śivapatārakasya prakāśa-ekavapuṣaḥ Prakāśa-ekarūpa eva bāvaḥ"*. *Patāraka* is a is a very high title so Śivapatāraka. However who transcends all these (means all these states of experience) who is constituted only of light, *prakāśa*. He has states or modes which are only of the form of light of consciousness. And there is a state even higher than uh Śiva as we said before. Śiva as a *tattva*, beyond that is uh Paramaśiva. *"Śrīmat-paramaśivsya punaḥ viśvottīrṇa-viśvamaya viśvātmaka-paramānanda-maya-prakāśaika-ghana-sya evam-vidham eva śivādhi-dhāraṇī dhāraṇīyan dhāraṇīyantam akhilaṃ abhedena eva sphurati"*. So at the level of the supreme Paramaśiva, who both transcends the universe and is the universe, who is highest bliss and consists of a mass of light of consciousness. He flashes the entire universe from Śiva down to the earth (means all the *tattvas*) in identity with himself. Actually let's state there is neither any other subject nor object, *grahya* nor *grāhaka*. Rather what is practically meant to be stated is that in actuality the highest bliss, Paramaśiva alone manifests himself in this way in numerous forms of multiplicity. 

So here he comes to his uh *advaita*. To his non-dualistic understanding of this whole multiplicity of levels of consciousness, levels of beings and um and *tattvas* etcetera. That ultimately is everything is pervaded by that same Paramaśiva who is both transcendent of the universe and immanent in the universe and is the universe. 

## Clarification on Patāraka, Bhairava, and Paramaśiva

But he had to go through this whole uh all these hierarchies you know to uh integrate this whole doctrine which is there in the Tantras and to say that it's okay. These hierarchies are there but ultimately they are also nothing but the light of the supreme Śiva. Now *Patāraka* is a is a title, huh? So um in uh the the goddess is called Patārikā and uh the the Śiva here is still at the level of the the highest *tattva*. But beyond all the *tattvas* is Paramaśiva, that's what he Or what was the question? What is the question? Yeah um. The Bhairava uh. The Bhairava uh the Yeah. The Bhairava or the *Patāraka* is the same like Parama or the Para? No, Bhairava I mean here he doesn't use the name Bhairava, but uh Bhairava would be at the level of Paramaśiva. Bhairava is not a *tattva*. No no no. Bhairava is at the level of Paramaśiva. Yeah yeah. No. Uh Śivapatāraka means Śiva as the highest uh reality level. Highest *tattva*. 

## The Practice of Integration and the Significance of Kala

Now what does this mean um all this complicated um passing through all these different levels of um mythologized uh experience? Practically it means that every level of consciousness by meditating on the *tattvas* as a an every *tattva* as an expression or as identical with Śiva, one can pass through all these levels and integrate them. And actually the *tattvas* are meditated upon and are also um in *dīkṣā*, in initiation, you pass through all the *tattvas* and you identify every *tattva* with Śiva. Starting from the earth. The earth is Śiva. Are every *tattva*, every element. So this integration into that non-dual vision of the whole uh universe and of the whole uh levels of um consciousness is um something to be practiced. But here he doesn't give much hint to the practice, that will come uh later in the text. 

So I see that because most of these um perceivers are called like uh *sakala* um *vijñānakala* and so on. This *kala* is um a factor which makes the bound soul. So *sakala* means somebody who is connected with um these factors, the totality of factors making up the bound soul. And the freedom from that would be *akala*. Somebody who who is *akala* means who is not bound by by those factors. So *pralayākala* for example is somebody he is also free from those factors but only because of a state of dissolution. It's not a real freedom. It's only a permanent uh a a permanent state. Suppose you are in the operation theater and you are under narcosis. You are also a *pralayākala*, but it is not the permanent uh freedom from uh yes. Deep sleep also, yes. Pralaya. *Pralayākala*. Yes, but *pralaya* of course is something more than deep sleep, but it can be if somebody goes into a coma is rather uh meant. And as I said some yogis who get into a wrong state of uh *samādhi* and um who are not uh progressing but rather going down with their consciousness that they can also be uh in that state. Rather than multiplicity *Kala* is multiplicity? Yes, Yes, yes. Yes. The root *kal* which is uh very important also, yeah. Also in the sense that *kala* it is also creativity but creativity in the sense of you know um putting um elements together. 

## Vijñānakalā and the Importance of Freedom in Action

And there is one stage, *vijñānakalā*, even those who are free from um free from multiplicity because of knowledge but they are although they have knowledge but they have no freedom to act. So they are still in the level of un-freedom. *Vijñānakala*. They are conscious but not active. So the whole sūtra and commentary was uh aiming at this correspondence of the the um subjective of the awareness of that state of being and its corresponding object. And this makes the multiplicity of the universe. There There are not just only external objects. These are only uh at the level of *sakala*. But there are so many levels of um perceivers and their perceptions. So you can put in the whole mythology, a whole uh a lot of um psychological states and uh even yogic states, but which are not the ultimate uh freedom, the ultimate uh consciousness. And that ultimate consciousness comes only with the uh at the level of Paramaśiva who is both immanent and transcendent. And of course that the *vijñāna* is a recognition which has to be with that highest level.
