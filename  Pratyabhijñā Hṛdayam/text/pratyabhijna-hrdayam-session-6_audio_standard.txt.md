## Namaḥ Śivāya

> namaḥ śivāya śatataṃ pañcakṛtya vibhāgine citānanda ghana svātma paramārtha vibhāṣine namaḥ śivāya śatataṃ pañcakṛtya vibhāgine citānanda ghana svātma paramārtha vibhāṣine 

These ślokas which you have, um, they are actually meditation verses. You can really use them when you start your meditation or when you start anything because they contain - I once have called it "philosophy in a nutshell" - the whole philosophy is contained in one verse. And then if you sing it, if you recite it, then it becomes more internalized. 

So we have started with, um, sūtra 12 and, um, I will try to cut it short, but I cannot cut it short completely because these are all, um, connected, um, topics which he puts into such a brevity and if one leaves out a whole topic, then something is missing in the whole system. So also, you need a little patience until we come really to the the practical aspects and the core. But, um, this is the this is the background. 

And what is important is that the energies we have, our own energies which are our our sense organs, our, um, intellect, or everything. These energies can also be obstacles or can also be leading to delusion by our own being deluded by our our own energies. So, **śakti** is a neutral term. Śakti can be this way or that way. And one aspect of śakti is also **language** and that is, uh, Raj said here, you don't find much of this whole philosophy of language but there's something, um, one aspect is here that language itself can also, uh, distract you, um, lead you into, uh, whole realm of, um, **vikalpa**, imagination, thought constructs, etc. 

So that is why the the alphabet, they are śaktis, but these śaktis can both, um, delude and lead you to liberation when there are, uh, you use these mantras, etc. So, this whole field is a very big field which is, uh, developed in the **Vātikā Vivaraṇa** of **Abhinavagupta** and here it is only hinted at.

Now, here he speaks of three levels on which this, um, both the delusion as well as the liberation can happen on. These are the levels of the **upāyas**. I suppose that everybody is familiar with the upāyas, but just for the sake of clarity, um, uh, let me connect it with what we are now going to read. This is in the order from descending from above and that is the order which Abhinavagupta has, um, adopted in the **Malinīvijayottara Tantra** from which these upāyas are derived. Um, uh, it, the Tantra starts from the lowest, that is **āṇava upāya**, is the individual means, and then rising to **śākta**, the means of energy, and **śāmbhava**, the divine way. And in the the Tantra, uh, there is no mention of **āṇavopāya**. So, Abhinavagupta has added a fourth, uh, stage which is **no means** um and **no way** and, um, you can see in this very example that these authors have been also handling tradition in a very free way. They have used what is revealed in the Tantras but then they have done it in their own, transformed it, and developed it into in their own way. So it is wrong to think that this tradition is something which is very much bound to the scriptures and so on. Scriptures are a starting point, but then it has been, uh, these ideas have been developed in a very free way. This is the best example that Abhinavagupta, uh, adds one highest means, highest way to these three traditional ways to liberation, that is **anupāya**, the no way.

And this is most important for us because **pratyabhijñā** is precisely situated at the level of anupāya. Actually, recognition does not require anything to do. We have already talked about it, but this is exactly where it corresponds. The spontaneous sudden flash of, um, recognition does not require any means, neither ritual nor yoga nor mantra, or nothing. But in the in his chapter on anupāya, I'm mentioning this because it's very much connected with our, the whole text. In his chapter on anupāya in the **Tantrāloka**, Abhinavagupta still mentions that what can cause this flash. Something can happen completely spontaneously, but there can be also, uh, some occasions on which this anupāya happens. And the important, um, thing is that it, once it happens, there is no falling back. Otherwise, there are experiences, there are very high mystical experiences but if you fall back, then you are in the lower, um, means. But in anupāya, once it happens, there is no falling back. 

And one of these occasions when it can happen, this recognition can happen is when you see a perfect being, a **siddha**, uh, a ṛṣi, or a yogi, or a Buddha, uh, an enlightened being and you are prepared, you are open, so that just the **darśana** alone is enough and you are already transported to that level. That's why at the end of the last, uh, class it was said that unless you have a **satguru**, um, these things remain concepts and they don't lead you to the experience. He has to not only to lead you but just to show you what is this state, what is this state of consciousness. 

So this is anupāya and, um, it can be just triggered by by some occasion. But after it happens, there is no falling back. 

And here, although this is the text on pratyabhijñā, so he should be leveled at the level of anupāya, but he gives, um, a chance to people or seekers who are at every level, from the lowest to the highest. Um 

**Question:** You had a question?

**Answer:** Yeah, just, I couldn't understand the question. There's no falling back. He said there is no falling back after the satguru shows you the state? Yeah. So you are like him after that or…?

**Answer:** Well I mean, um, see there are many, uh, possibilities in the spiritual path that people have very great experiences, but still they have to come back to a lower level to to work it, uh, up, you know. You have a great experience and then still you have to labor hard to integrate that experience into your, um, ordinary life. But there are experiences which are permanent. I mean, I have given the example of **Ramana Maharshi** that, uh, he had this experience, he was 16 years old, and he never fell back. I mean, there was no, so anyhow, this, uh, many examples can be, um, uh, given, but this is precisely the level of pratyabhijñā. 

Then here he gives, um, a possibility for, even at the lower level, āṇavopāya, which, um, works with, uh, yoga, ritual, prāṇa, etc., uh, all the means connected with the body, with the, um, not so much with the mind, with the body, and, um, śāktopāya is the way of **knowledge**. It's a way of knowledge. And **mantra**, at different levels, at the, um, level of āṇava, at the individual, and at the level of śākta, uh, it works in a different way. So, mantra, um, has a different levels. 

And śāmbhava is very close to anupāya. That is why, um, pratyabhijñā can also be placed at the level of śāmbhava. That is the divine way, the way way of, uh, **will**. It's, uh, that **pure** pure, um, uniting one's will with the divine. That is, uh, śāmbhavopāya, where the disciple does not take the initiative, but the initiative is taken by the divine or by the guru. I mean, if the guru finds the disciple very advanced, then, uh, he gives him, um, śāmbhavopāya, the divine. 

Now we are coming to this, um, in, yes, and then there are two, in the explanation of this sūtra, he gives two levels: one is, in the whole of Śaiva, uh, theology there are three, um, components, especially also in **Śaiva Siddhānta**: uh, **pati**, **paśu**, and **pāśa**. Now, paśu is, um, uh, literally the **bound**, uh, soul. It's a, uh, paśu is also an animal, but it's a bound soul. And pati is the **Lord**. So either you are at the level of the bound, at the of **bondage**, or of **liberation**. At the level of bondage, you are a paśu, and at the level of liberation, you are the Lord himself. So he gives the interpretation in, uh, the three upāyas at these two levels. Now we'll go, uh, through these stages. So, uh, sūtra 12 commentary:

> asya etasya sadā sambhavatā vanaśavidagṛhīta kāritvā kāritvā asya aparijñāne

So then the **ignorance** or not full, incomplete knowledge. Actually, um, it's not complete ignorance, but the incomplete knowledge of this, of the authorship of this five acts which occur also in the individual **śaktipāta**. 

> he to ka sva bala unmīlana a a vat ap prakāśanaya

And because of the lack of the manifestation of the power of śaktipāta. So śaktipāta in the which was the starting point also, the entering point. So at the lack of śaktipāta. 

> There is ignorance of these five um five acts occurring in at every a perception sense perception also

> Svabala one's own power or the absence of one's own power ap prakāśanaya 

Which, uh, is not manifest, um, due to the absence of this śaktipāta. There is a state of **delusion**. And this delusion can manifest, I have given you the quotation of Abhinavagupta in the **Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa**. It can be manifested by **doubts** which are related both to worldly and to religious, um, scripture scriptural. 

> So the śāstras also they they create a lot of confusion sometimes. Lot of doubts. Laukika and śāstraya saṃka.

So these doubts are, when there is no clarity because of the lack of śaktipāta, then both worldly, uh, thoughts and and scriptural, the scriptures are often contradictory, uh, they can cause this, uh, delusion.

> And this is the very state of saṃsāri. Saṃsāritvam. And this is the very cause um through ignorance people are subject to uncertainty hence follow births and deaths.

And then he, um, uh, what I said before. He comes to the topic of the of language, which is both binding and liberating. It is liberating in the form of mantra and it is binding when it creates a a, um, so many vikalpas, so many, um, thoughts, binding, uh, thoughts. 

> So this whole alphabet ending with a and uh beginning with a and ending with kha becomes a cause of bondage.

And then he refers, well, this is a kind of text, you know, where he, he compacts everything, all the topics which are available. And that's why it is so, uh, dense. The four levels of language or of **vāk**, I'm not writing it now, this is in the text itself. And these four levels, um, from the transcendent level, **parā**, the absolute level of language, down to **paśyantī**, the visionary level, which is, uh, beyond, still beyond thought, but it is the **source of language** and the **source of thought**, then to **madhyamā**, that is the language at the level of thought, and then to **vaikharī**, the, uh, uttered, manifested, um, external language where the whole multiplicity of languages, etc. So this, uh, **descent of the word** from the supreme level down to vaikharī, that can also be a cause of bondage because it, it creates, um, numberless, uh, thoughts, vikalpa. In a descending order. Of course, the liberating process, um, is in the ascending order, from the spoken word to the thought, to the source of, um, thought and word, and to the, um, highest, uh, transcendent level of parā. 

And then these, um, groups of letters, they are connected with certain **deities**, **goddesses**. He says that we don't need to go into this, Brāhmī, etc., he gives the table on page 141.

> And they produce all these thoughts, vikalpa. And the essential difference between this bondage and liberation is one of differentiation, **bheda**, or non-differentiation, **abheda**.

So, if language, um, binds you in a whole world of differentiation, bheda, then it leads to **saṃsāra** and on the ascending way you rise from the differentiation to non-differentiation to abheda. Or from vikalpa to **nirvikalpa** or to **avikalpa**.

So at the end of this page 80, this was the the binding aspect was the state of **paśu**, of the bound soul. But in the state of **pati**, of the Lord:

> patitasyāṃ tu bhedesaṃhāram abheditaḥ sarga sthiti prakṛtyāntā prakṛtyāntyā kramāt kramāt vikalpa nir nirghāsane na śrīmat bhairavamudrā anupraveśamīm mahatīm avikalpabhūmiṃ eva unmilayati

Now he gives us always some hints at some, uh, mystical states. This is called here **bhairavamudrā**. 

In the pati state, however, this state is manifesting withdrawal in respect of difference and emanation and maintains in respect of non-difference. Gradually, by reducing the vikalpas, discloses the great **avikalpa stage**, the thought-free stage, which enables one to enter into the blissful bhairavamudrā. 

Now here suddenly he gives us a hint at, uh, what this avikalpa state can, uh, produce. 

> At which stage this śakti cause to appear the pure vikalpa śakti which is deeply merged in consciousness and bliss.

Now, what is this bhairavamudrā? There is also a beautiful hymn by Abhinavagupta, but unfortunately I didn't bring all this. Bhairavamudrā is a state where **antarlakṣya bahirdṛṣṭi**. That is something which one can, one cannot really practice, but it can occur when these vikalpas are reduced. Antarlakṣya bahirdṛṣṭi. You keep that, uh, supreme goal within, antarlakṣya, but your eyes are open with open eyes. So it is a kind of **samādhi with open eyes**. And, um, it is called **mudrā** because it, the body also assumes a certain **posture**. But it's not something consciously assumed, something which, uh, occurs the moment these vikalpas are, um, disappear. There is this, this liberating moment that this difference between **inside and outside** also, uh, is overcome. So you remain deeply within, but you can, with open eyes. And this, some of these saints, you had this mudrā, you know, you can see they, they see without seeing. That is also in that Abhinavagupta's, uh… "**Seeing without seeing**" means without seeing an object. The eyes are open, but the whole attention is drawn within. Antar lakṣya bahirdṛṣṭi. This is bhairavamudrā. So it is a, uh, divine state. That is why the pati state.

And then here comes, um, the one of the most important and very consoling kārikās of **Utpaladeva's** **Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā**, which is actually philosophical text, but then he also gives this, uh, mystical openings. 

> sarvomāmayāṃ vibhavaṃ iti evaṃ parijānatā viśvātmano vikalpanāṃ prasarepi maheśvaraḥ 

> Page 81

He who knows that all this glory, this whole universal glory is mine:

> And sarvomāmayāṃ vibhavaṃ iti evaṃ parijānatā

And who realizes that the entire cosmos is his **self**, that the entire universe, **viśvātmana**, universal self, even when his vikalpas, even when his thoughts are still flowing forth, he has attained the state of the Supreme Lord.

So this means that vikalpas are not necessarily an obstacle. But even when you have already attained the highest stage. Even when this vikalpas are flowing, uh, forth, uh, you you are in that divine, uh, stage. 

And this is a great **consolation** also for **meditators** because there are people who are very, uh, advanced in meditation and still they come and tell me, "Oh, still I have all these thoughts crossing my mind in meditation." Let it happen, let it happen. It does not, uh, prevent that divine state. The only problem is when we give them too much attention. 

> But even those who have reached that highest level, still their vikalpas may uh flow. But it does not prevent their divinity, **maheśvaraḥ**. But of course here the experience is one of universal um universality. Sarvomāmayāṃ. This whole glory of the whole universe is mine. It's my manifestation. 

There's such expressions in Vedānta also. When they… Hmm, Vedānta maybe hotter:

> vikalpanāṃ prasarepi maheśvaraḥ

So now this, uh, this two stages of paśu and pati are related to the śāmbavopāya, to the, uh, divine means. And now he comes to the śāktopaya, the **way of energy**. 

> citra citi śaktirīva bhagavatī viśvava manoratha saṃsāravāma vāma ācārātvāc ca vāmeśvaryākhyā satī

Now here comes, um, a group of **śaktis**, starting from **vāmeśvarī**. Now there is always, um, a misunderstanding when **tantra**, the the right hand and left hand tantra. Now, **vāma** and the **left-hand tantra** is misunderstood as just being something, um, something to do with sexual practices and this and that. But vāma means something else here. Vāma is connected with the **goddess** vāmeśvarī and the root **vam**, where it has, uh, etymologically to do with English "**to vomit**," vam. To **spew out**. To **emanate**. So because she's, she is, uh, emanating the universe, that is why she's vāmeśvarī. At the same time, the other meaning of vāma is **left**. Left means at the, in the **opposite direction**. Something which goes in the opposite direction, **saṃsāravāmācāra**. But because she goes in the opposite direction of saṃsāra. So, **dakṣiṇā** is that which is the ordinary, normal direction and vāma is that, the opposite direction. So it gives a completely different meaning from of this so-called left-handed, uh, tantra. And it has to do with the śakti vāmeśvarī and that is the tantra also, one vāmakeśvarī tantra. 

Now, at the stage of paśu, of the limited soul, of the bound soul, this vāmeśvarī, this goddess manifests at a different levels, in a brief, um, which are different śaktis. That is why this belongs to the śāktopāya. And these, uh, śaktis are either in descending order from **kecarī** to **pūtarī** or in ascending order from pūtarī to kecarī, um, um, reading a very brief, uh, definition of these, um, śaktis. The highest śakti is kecarī. **Kha** means **space**, **sky**. She who moves in the sky, she is completely, um, free to move in the sky of consciousness. 

The meaning of kecarī is as follows:

> that śakti is kecarī who are biting in kha, that is in and the sky of consciousness which is identical with herself roams about a functions in various ways, carati. This kecarī in her universal aspect functions in three ways. She is as **ghūcarī**, brings about the knowledge of objects; as **dictarī**, effects movement, such as grasping, relinquishing, etcetera; as **pūcarī**, exists in the form of objective existence. Thus this kecarī exists at ghūcarī in the form of the inner organs, as dictarī in the form of external organs or the senses, as pūcarī in the form of objective, uh, existence, etcetera. And in the individual aspects the śaktis that are known successively as **brahmacārī** in the void of consciousness, uh, in which the distinction between subject and object has not yet appeared. As ghūcarī in the form of the inner organs, **antaḥkaraṇa**, in which there is just appearance of knowledge. As dictarī in the form of the outer senses, suggesting the appearance of diversity, in which state there is diversity of the knower from the knowable object. And as pūcarī in the form of existence of objective things, in which there is preponderance of clear diversity in the objects. But these are in reality, according to the principle enunciated, non-distinct from kecarī, which abides in the essential nature of the Absolute. Thus, the śakti of the Supreme Lord is only one… you wanted to know the page number, 92 is a quotation from Abhinavagupta's **vīravaraṇa**.

So these śaktis, um, this belongs to the **krama** system or the **mārga** system, as we have said in the morning. As they're leading downwards, they lead to saṃsāra and to bondage. But in the state on page 82, in the state of the, uh, pati:

> patibhūmikayām

The śakti manifests herself as **citkaganācarī**, whose essence consists in universal doership, **sarvakartṛtva**. As ghūcarī, whose essence consists in the ascertainment of non-difference. As dictarī, whose essence consists in the perception of non-difference. And as pūcarī, whose essence consists in revealing objects as non-different like limbs of oneself.

So, in the light of the, uh, divine, these, uh, śaktis are, um, leading to a state of non-difference, abheda. So this is the, at the level of śāktopāya, the way of energy. And so where the śaktis are both either deluding or leading to non-difference, to liberation. And at the level of āṇavopāya, that is the way of, uh, the individual, um, where the individual being is identified with the body, with the prāṇa, so and, etcetera. That is why, uh, one has to do yoga and, uh, **prāṇāyāma** and and all these, uh, practices which are connected with the **body consciousness**. 

> And um cidātmanaparamēśvarasya svā anapayinī ēkāyēva sphurati sāra kartṛtā ātmā aiśvaryāśaktiḥ

This power of, uh, glory, **aiśvaryāśakti**, of the Lord, whose essential nature is consciousness, which is unique, unfailing, and whose essential nature consists in doership, is essentially a spr- flashing forth of divine light.

> When she is concealing her real nature, she causes delusion in the state of the limited soul, bound soul.

But see, there are five **prāṇas**, five prāṇas, and at the stage of limitation these prāṇas are leading to a dispersion of, um, instead of leading to **concentration**, they are dispersing. But on the, um, in the opposite, um, directional stage of the divine, pati, these prāṇas are used for concentration of, for rising, uh, to that divine state. 

> When however she unfolds she is always a śakti. She unfolds the **udāna śakti** that appears in **madhyadhāmanā**.

Now, this is one of the secrets of the whole practice of, um, **kaśmīra śaivism** and we will come to that. Madhyadhāmanā. There is the duality of prāṇa and **apāna**. Outbreath and, uh, breathing out and breathing in, the **exhalation** and **inhalation**, and when the consciousness reaches that **center**, central part, madhyadhāmanā, then it's the rising breath, udāna. And these are compared with **sun**, **moon**, and **fire**. That is typical, um, images of this **tantric yoga**. And udāna śakti, udāna prāṇa, rises in that madhyadhāmanā in the central, which is **suṣumnā**. So this is the āṇavopāya by, um, this is the point of rising which, uh, is the turning point of from the distraction to the **internalization** and the concentration.

> And uh when um udāna is not the last the the last is **vyāna** that is the pervasion that universal pervasion of prāṇa pervasiveness vyāna śakti whose essence is to pervade the universe and which appears um yeah he relates it to the four stages of consciousness waking dream deep sleep and the fourth etcetera

But… So the point is here, the **entering into the central channel** of the, uh, udāna prāṇa. 

**Question:** Concept of prāṇa? Five prāṇas, can you explain it more clearly? Uh, the secret has to be a little more in detail. All the five prāṇas should I explain? The secret of the rising prāṇa, udāna. 

**Answer:** So the duality of, uh, prāṇa and, um, apāna gets united in the central channel, which is suṣumnā, by the rising breath, udāna. So the the prefix **ud** is always **rising**, something rising. And if the the sun and the moon are, uh, the the two breaths, prāṇa and apāna, are compared with the sun and the moon and udāna with fire, why? Because fire is always rising. And, um, and it has that energy. And then, well, **samāna** is also there, there are five, uh, prāṇas, uh, samāna is the, uh, **general**, uh, breath and vyāna is the pervasive, uh, **all-pervasive**, uh, form of prāṇa which goes beyond the body. 

And once this has:

> the dehādi ava sthāyām api patidadā ātmā

So once this is realized, this, um, rising of the, uh, energy even in the state of body, being embodied, one attains the divine state. 

> dehādi ava sthāyām api patidadā ātmā

> And being in the body, attaining the state of the Lord, it is **jīvanmukti**, that is liberation while alive. 

So here, that the starting point is that udāna śakti and the madhyama- madhyadhāmanā.

So these are three ways, um, the, from śāmbhava, śākta, and āṇava, in which the individual soul becomes both deluded with his own powers and liberated by the same powers. Now what is the **turning point** that we'll come in the next sūtra? It's a question of the turning point.

> And ēvam saṅkucitaśaktiprāṇādi man api yadā svaśaktibyāmohito na bhavati

So when this, uh, limited, contracted energy is not no longer deluded by her own energies, then:

> śarīrī paramēśvara

Being embodied you are the Supreme Lord. The embodied one is the Supreme Lord.

> It jñānaya that according to these āgamas according to the tantras he is śiva himself śivāvatārak ēva

> And there's another manuṣyadēhamāsthāya canāsthi paramēśvaraḥ 

Being established in a **human body**, they are the Supreme Lord in **hidden form**. It's very beautiful. So those **realized souls**, realized beings, they are still in a human body, but they are hidden, the divinity in hidden form. 

> canāsthi paramēśvaraḥ

And now comes the turning point in sutra 13:

> Uktasūtrāt prati prati pratipakṣēṇātastva-dṛṣṭiṁ darśayitum āha

So he presents always his matter first negatively, then positively. So once he has presented it in a negative way, then a positive follows, um, uh, can be the description can be much shorter. The the **pratipatti pratipakṣēṇa**, in the opposite direction, conversely.

> Tat-parijñānē cittaṁ ēva antaḥ-mukhi-bhāvēna cētana-padādhyārōhāt cittiḥ.

So this is now the the reverse way from that descent down to the mind that to the limitation. And the crucial point is **antaḥ-mukhi-bhāvēna**, by **internalization**. By **turning within**. By interiorization, antaḥ-mukhi-bhāvēna. And by this knowledge, by this complete knowledge, **tat-parijñānē**, the mind itself, which is turned within, antaḥ-mukhi-bhāvēna, becomes **pure consciousness** by rising through **cētana**. Not, cētana is that mediating form of consciousness which is, uh, leads us from **citta** to pure **cittiḥ**. And before we had it in the, uh, opposite way, and now this is the return to pure consciousness by internalizing, by interiorization, antaḥ-mukhi-bhāvēna. So this is the very first condition, a first entrance into that state of recognition. 

That reminds me, um, the turning point, just before coming here, I met **Swami Lakshman Joo's** disciple in in Delhi. He and she told me a story that, um, one swami from **Hridaya**, he came to meet Swami Lakshman Joo when at the his early stages, early ashram. And that swami asked him, "Swamiji, what was the **turning point** in your spiritual life?" Swamiji said, "Turning point? Uh, there was no turning point. I was there from the very beginning." But this is a very rare rare, uh, cases. 

So giving up the limited tendency of **extroversion**, becoming **introverted**, rising to the status of cētana means consciousness, **embodied consciousness**, gradually it rises to the status of the **knowing subject**, where by the dissolution of the aspect of limitation:

> cētana-padādhyārōhāt grāhaka-bhūmikāṁ pūrṇa-bhūmikā-ākramēna krameṇa saṁkōca-kalāyā api vikalanēna svarūpāpattyā cittaṁ bhavati.

By the dissolution of that state of limitation or of contraction, **vikalanēna**, attaining its real nature, **svarūpāpattyā**, it becomes pure consciousness. It now enters its own highest stage of citti, chit.

> Svaṁ-cinmayīṁ parāṁ bhūmikāṁ āviśati.

The true nature of one's own state state of pure consciousness. 

> Svaṁ-cinmayīṁ parāṁ bhūmikāṁ āviśati

And this āviśati again, remember this **samāvēśa āvēśa**, this complete **pervasion**, complete, uh, in that state of pure consciousness. 

Now we stop here and, um, as I had told you already before that the practical, um, the practices leading to this are described at the very end of the sutras and, um, so, but we we in the next, uh, days, we have, uh, enough time to go into this practical, uh. So actually, the practices are described in the very last sutra, but still, um, from sutra, uh, even now, sutra, uh, 15, 16, 17, uh, it, you are led to the experiential aspect which, so far, you may have felt it as very theoretical. But this is the whole theory underlying that experience, which, uh, is the experience which you find in the **Vijñānabhairava**.

**Question:** So, if this text is from the perspective of the highest upaya, right? Is there kind of any talk of, you know, you have to be a special disciple to be able to operate at that level? And at the level of, you know, average human beings who might not be at that highest level yet, is it said that, you know, that we need to go through kind of, um, beginning level stages to get to that point, or can everyone practice at that level and aspire to attain some kind of results?

**Answer:** Yeah, that's an important question relating to the upayas. Actually, ideally, if you have a guru, the guru knows which upaya you need. So he will give you that initiation or that, um, uh, practice which relates to your state of consciousness or your level. And then he will lead you, uh, to higher levels. But if you don't have a guru, um, well, there are, in all the texts, they say, "There are three ways: the guru, the śāstra, and one's own experience." The guru, the text. So if you, if you read, there are people who read the Vijñānabhairava and they, they strike upon one tāra, another say, "Oh, this is exactly what, um, I want to practice," or that. So then that śāstra, that āgama, that tantra gives you the guidance if you don't have a guru. So the three possibilities can be separate. Your own experience, if it is a a sudden insight without any guru, without any text. Um, but then, it needs confirmation from the text and from the guru. So ideally, the three should go together. But, um, even, I mean, I know many people who have got very high experience by reading some of these texts. And then it's ideal to confirm it, uh, with a guru or, and of course, with one's own experience. So, गुरुतः शास्त्रतः स्वतः. And, um, so to determine which upaya you need, or which exact practice you need, if you don't have a guru, you have to go through the scriptures and, uh, find something which is really corresponding to your state or to your search or to your need, your spiritual need. And then you don't stop at one level. If you start with aṇavopāya, people do a lot of yoga, prāṇāyāma, and all that, but this is not the end. This is, it is a purification. It is a preparation. But, um, and then, you can be led to a higher, uh, upaya. So these are the three possibilities and one shouldn't despair if one doesn't have a, uh, ideal guru. 

**Question:** Yes. The the difference between avikalpa and nirvikalpa? Vikalpa is thought, and a- avikalpa nirvikalpa means the same. It's just a thought-free, thought-free state. No difference? No. 

**Answer:** If there are no questions and, um, an announcement. 

**Question:** Yes, please. I was wondering about this śiva, the eater. What? In one of the chants, ślokas,**Question:** Yes, please. I was wondering about this śiva, the eater. What? In one of the chants, ślokas, it is śiva, the eater. And I don't…  Ah. Uh, yes, yes. and that is one of the thing I am wondering about. And there is another thing which I am trying to figure out because our previous teachings we are having, I feel so confident that once you have a complete experience uh you see that experience has to permeate everything. There cannot be any seat left out because it isn't it it is the internal knowledge which must be shining forth. And that somehow my understanding, you see, either if it shines forth, it will permeate everything. So that is why I stumble about because, you know, I just read the comics, you know, kind of in the picture o- of the of the old saints. And I saw like you were saying that there is something and they fall down. And and you said before there is like one seed which is in kind of is still there and they have to descend. And I cannot understand because once you have that, it must penetrate everything. It cannot be a seat left because that means if you get the understanding, you have the understanding for everything. So, can you explain please these two things? 

**Answer:** Yes. I don't know what, where is a Śiva, the eater. <noise> Um Śiva bhoktā, Śiva uh Śiva dātā Śiva bhoktā. No, this, uh, expresses just the fact that there is only one subject and that is the divine subject. So it is not, um, this **non-duality** means there is only one aham, only one "I". And our egos, our limited egos, ultimately, with that experience, um, become one with that supreme "I," that supreme aham. So, that is why, uh, it is not the limited being which is doing anything at that level, but it is the divine, um, divine, uh, aham, the divine "I". That is expressed like this. Śiva is the giver, both the giver and the eater. If he is only the giver and we are the eater, then there is duality. We are the receiver, but he's also the receiver. 

And the second, um, point is definitely it has to, um, uh, include everything, definitely. Uh, but where was the contradiction? Where did you find the contradiction? 

**Question:** You said in the morning that, uh, we always hear that some of the sages, there is some seed which is still there and they have to descend again. There is something undigested, and then it becomes vikalpa again.

**Answer:** Well, I mean, see, that complete realization, that will, of course, there is not, no coming back. But there are stages and there are stages where… There there is a coming back, and I think even in in Buddhism, ah, until you are completely enlightened, um, you, the these Bhoomigalas also and, uh, you reach a very high level and then again you come to a lower level. This is a whole process until that full, uh, pratibhā is, uh, attained. 

But there is another aspect also which I mean, I am speaking now from experience with my Guru and with, uh, for example, Ramana Maharshi, somebody who had this highest experience, but then has to integrate the whole life, you know, what happened to Ramana Maharshi? He had that enlightenment at the age of 16. Then, for 7 years, he was in silence, not because he took a vow of silence, but he couldn't just, couldn't speak because that experience was so powerful that it, it made him silent. In the case of Swamiji, um, as he said, there was no turning point. He had it from his childhood. But then that experience and that had to be, it has to be lived through as long as we are in the body. There's so many, uh, so many experiences, so many levels to be integrated. And, um, the one can see that in the case of these realized beings, they, they don't descend from their level, but they have to integrate everything into, uh, into life. And this is a whole, uh, process. That's why **jīvanmukti** is much more difficult than **videhamukti**. Well, once you are liberated and you leave, uh, leave the body, that's finished. But jīvanmukti is not easy because you have to live with this body and with that powerful experience through a whole long life. And Swamiji lived with this for, uh, 85 years from his childhood. So this is a, this is a task of integrating everything into that experience. 

**Question:**  Is jīvanmukti easy or not? Is that ascension not easy? 

**Answer:** And there is another aspect that this… That only the Swamiji said, "Why why does Abhinavagupta explain the, by the, from going from above, below?" It, because this is meant not for disciples, but for Gurus. And the Guru who has reached that highest stage, he has to **come down for the sake of the disciples**. So he has to come down to the level of aṇava to to teach the disciple aṇavopāya. And, uh, he's not leaving his status, but he descends, and that is another kind of, uh, bodhicitta, to help the others to rise. He has to come down. And this is, uh… A jīvanmukti is also a kind of bodhisattva. 

**Question:** Yeah, yeah.

**Answer:** Is diktat… mike? Is this the mike?

**Question:** And we're talking about divinity, so is divinity something like ego lessness? Could you hear? And we are talking about the divinity. So is that something like uh being ego less? Is divinity like ego lessness? Divinity and ego lessness are they same? Is divinity equal to ego lessness? Yeah?

**Answer:**  Yes, yes, of course. I mean, that, uh, ego cannot remain. Yeah, uh, definitely. Yeah, thank you. 

**Answer:** And what you were saying earlier, there's also that about reaching different stages and then falling down again and attaining the higher state. There's also, probably there, also the element of a constant practice then. You have an insight into a particular stage, and then you have to constantly hold your awareness. It's a constant practice so that you remain at that stage and then maybe, you know, overcome it, and it's like, you know, an ant trying to climb something and then slips a little and then climbs again.

**Response:** Yeah, yes. Yeah. 

**Question:** When talking about that… When talking about the five acts of Shiva, you said that the four acts, they're their aim is liberation, the final act. So why… Yeah, the grace. So why not only grace? Why… Why do you need five acts if the, co, if the purpose is one act, the grace? Why why are there five?

**Answer:** Well, it's a whole, um, uh, cosmology. We see the, um, the universe is there. Our body is there. We cannot deny, uh, that, uh, there is multiplicity. So you need also to integrate and to understand that whole of reality which is, uh, a constant process. That the process as we see it in nature, in our body, in our, uh, constant, uh, new creation and, uh, again dissolution and… So this process, to bring it from the cosmic level to the individual level and then to the spiritual level. That is the, that is the the point. Not to exclude it, not to say, "Now, forget about the world. You just sit in your cave and, uh…" as some, uh, people do, um. But this whole cosmic process has to be integrated. And of course, he gives, uh, very special, um, stress on this, this, of course the whole Shaiva, uh, theology is in the background. But then it leads to that, um, integration in the individual consciousness and then in the, uh, the spiritual level that nothing is excluded. This is…
