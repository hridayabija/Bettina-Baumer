## Om̐ namaḥ śivāya śāntāya pañcakṛtyavighātine cītānandaghaṇasvātmā paramārthapradāyine namaḥ śivāya śāntāya pañcakṛtyavighātine cītānandaghaṇasvātmā paramārthapradāyine

Sūtra 18 gives the whole collection of upāyas in one sūtra. Now, what is so important about sūtra 17 is that we are used to so complicated yoga texts, you know, this haṭha yoga, so many complications, these cakras, that nāḍī, and this, uh, and sometimes, uh, contradicting each other and so on. But here, he goes just to the core of the matter—the core, literally, matter. And he doesn't go into this, uh, complexities of, um, yoga practices and so on. But it is very clear that in this tradition, this, uh, literally central practice is this entering into the central vein, *madhyanāḍī*, by means of, um—Yes. I mean, here, there's no other, um, means. 

What is *vikāsa*? See, he has translated as development, but I think it has been clear that you are not, um, doing anything to the central vein, you are only keeping—fixing your awareness there—where the whole prāṇic energy is concentrated and rising in that *madhyanāḍī*. So, this is in the background of the whole practice. 

And then in the next sūtra, he comes to some, um, particular *upāyas* which are connected—And—But there are others are possible. All these *ṛddhi*, etc., etc., etc. There's so many ways. 

He introduces the sūtra with a simple statement: 

> *madhyavikāse yuktam aha*

He states the method for attaining the expansion of the center. 

> *vikalpa-kṣayaḥ śakti-saṅkoca-vikāsaḥ vāha-chedādy antaḥkoṭi-nibhālanādayaḥ iha upāyaḥ*

The means here are the following: 

1. **vikalpa-kṣayaḥ:** the solution of the thought constructs, or—Yeah, the solution of *vikalpa*.
2. **śakti-saṅkoca-vikāsa:** the, um, contraction and expansion of energy.
3. **vāha-chedā:** the interruption of the streams. The streams, *vāha*, are, of course, the streams of *prāṇa*, breath. 
4. **antaḥkoṭi-nibhālanā ādi antaḥ—**Sorry. **ādi antaḥkoṭi—**Did I make a mistake? No, this is wrong. **vāha-chedā antaḥkoṭi-nibhālana.** That means the—He says, the practice of the contemplation of the point of the beginning and the end. *nibhālanā* means also kind of, uh, concentration or, um, observing. *nibhālanā—*Just see the alternative translation. *nibhālanā:* perception, perceiving, observing, something like that. Observing. Observing the the points at the beginning and ending points. etc. *ādayaḥ*.

These are the means here.

Would you repeat the—the method and the English translation?

*vikalpa-kṣayaḥ—*Huh? All four? All the four? 

Yes. 

1. *vikalpa-kṣaya*, the solution of thoughts.
2. *śakti-saṅkoca-vikāsa* is one. That's both the, uh, contraction and expansion of energy is two. 
3. *vāha-chedā—*Huh? Interruption of streams of the—I've already translated. Interruption of breath? *vāha-chedā* is the, um, in-, uh, interruption of the streams—of the currents of breath. *chedā* means interrup-, uh, breaking, cutting. He says, "Cutting of the *vāha*, of the flows—flows of *prāṇa*.
4. And *ādi antaḥkoṭi-nibhālanā*, observing the beginning and ending point.

So, all this will be explained. And these are very typical practices of this, uh, tradition. 

> *iha madhya-śakti-vikāse vikalpa-kṣayādaya upāyaḥ*

Here, in this tradition, the means are the—the means for the enforcement or, um, expansion of the center are the dis- dissolution of thoughts, etc. 

Now, the—the first question arises immediately, but we will, uh, go through the text. The question always arises, what is cause and what is effect? Because the purpose of all these practices is to dissolve the thoughts. See, whatever method you, uh, apply, but ultimately, it has to lead to *nirvikalpa*, to a state of—to a thought-free state. So—And sometimes, this question arises in the, uh, *Vijñānabhairava* itself. Uh, that *nirvikalpa* is the means or it is the end? But it's actually, it's—it's—it's like a cycle, you know, that, um, something which leads you—something. It is presupposed and it's also the result. So it—this is actually a process. It is a process of attaining that thought-free state. *Vijñānabhairava* is full of such, uh, practices. 

Now, let us concentrate what he says here. 

> *prāg-upadiṣṭa-pañca-vidha-kṛtya-kāritvādy anusā- anusāraṇena sarva-madhya-bhūtāya-saṁvido vikāso jāyate*

Because, um, of the earlier described—earlier instructed, um, or according to the earlier instruction regarding the, um, practice of the five, uh, fivefold, um, acts, fivefold—Or authorship, uh, uh, *pañca-kṛtya-kāritvā*, the authorship of the fivefold acts, the *sarva-madhya-bhūtāya-saṁvido vikāso jāyate*, the unfoldment or the—the expansion of consciousness which is *sarva-madhya-bhūtāya*, which forms the center of all. Means of all practices, the expansion of consciousness is the central one. This has already been, uh, stated. This has already been taught.

> *upāyāntaraṁ apy atra ucyate*

Now he tells another means. 

> *prāṇāyāma-mudrā-bandha bandhādi-samasta-yantrana tantra-trotanena sukhopāyaṁ eva*

He tells another means, which is an easy means, which is, um, free from all these complications of *prāṇāyāma-mudrā-bandha*, etc. All these, uh, *haṭha-yogic*, uh, practices. It's clear when he says *sukhopāyaṁ*, it is free from, uh, this *haṭha-yogic* practices. And what does it consist in?

> *hṛdaye nihita-citta ukta-yuktyā svasthiti-pratibandhakaṁ vikalpaṁ akiñcit-cintaka-tvenā praśamayan*

Holding your mind in the heart, fixing your mind in the heart. This is a absolutely universal. So many spiritual, uh, teachers, uh, teach that, even, uh, like Ramana Maharshi, you know, fixing the mind in the heart, bringing the mind down from the into the heart. It's *hṛdaye nihita-citta*. In three words, everything is said. Bring the mind down to the heart. And—By the method, uh, yeah, by the method *ukta-yuktyā*. *Yukti* is a—is a method, is a yogic method. Restraining the thoughts, *vikalpa*, which—which are an obstacle to be established in one's own state, *svasthiti-pratibandhakaṁ*. The *vikalpas* are the main obstacle preventing us from being established in our own nature, in our own very own state. And bringing—Here, *vikalpa* is in singular, thought. Bringing thought to rest, *praśamayan*, by not thinking anything. It's very simple, very easy. *akiñcit-cintaka-tvenā*—*cintaka-tvenā*—*cintaka-tvenā*—By not thinking anything, bringing the thought to rest—by bringing the thought to—done to the heart—thought which is—which prevents um—that—as being established in one's own state.

Now, this expression *akiṃcicyintakaḥ cintăkatven* it comes from the *Malinīvijayottara Tantra* and it describes the highest *upāya* that is *śāmbhavopāya*, that is the divine way, the divine way. And there are only three verses in the *Malinīvijayottara Tantra* describing the three means. And this Abhinavagupta has expanded into twelve volumes of describing these three or four *upāyas*—three verses. And *śāmbhavopāya*, the divine way, is just described as *akiṃcicyintakaḥ*—not thinking anything, free of thought, thought-free awareness. 

So, this is of course the highest means, and as we have said before, highest means is only possible if the yogi is already advanced or is very capable of that. Because otherwise you may sit in meditation and say, “Well, I'm not thinking anything.” It doesn't happen. Your thoughts go on um and uh they will not listen to your instruction. So, this really happens at the highest level. *akiṃcicyintakaḥ cintăkatven*—Bringing the thoughts to a peaceful state. 

But as Abhinavagupta tells us, one should never start too low. You should try from the highest level. If you are not able to maintain that, then you can come a little lower down and take some other means. But the aim is always to start or to try the highest. So, this is our aim: not to think, to uh be free of this disturbing *vikalpas* and to bring the mind into the heart. So, this is the *śāmbhavopāya*.

> *vikalpa parāmarśena dehādikaluṣaḥ svacitpramātratānivālanāt pravṛṇnaḥ acirādeva unmiṣatvikāsāṃ turīyatūrīyātītasamāveśadaśām āsādayati*

By laying hold of the thought-free state, the yogi becomes used to the habit of regarding his consciousness, *cit*, as the real knower. *svacitpramātratānivālanaḥ*—he cultivates or he—the consid—considering consciousness as the real knower, that means not the ego or not the mind, but *cit*, *svacit*, pure consciousness, which is not um polluted by the identification with the body—*dehād  akaluṣaḥ*—identification with the body, *prāṇaḥ*, mind, etcetera. *vikalpaparāmarśena*—*parāmarśa* is also a reflection or a concentration, meditation on the thought-free state. 

And without further delay, *acirāt*, without any delay, um he will reach the state of *turīya* and *turīyātīta*, the state of absorption into the fourth and transcending the fourth. Now, some may not be familiar with the state transcending the fourth, *turīyātīta*, because in all Indian systems you have these four: *jāgrat, svapna, suṣupti, turīya*. *Turīya* is the uh state of uh *samādhi* or whatever. But *turīyātīta* is very important in this system because *turīya* is still a state which may be limited by time. You may be in *samādhi* for one hour, two hours, three hours, but not for twenty-four hours. Whereas *turīyātīta*, transcending the fourth, means to carry this state of consciousness into all the other states. And then we had those who had done the *Śivāsūtras*, we had this *triśūcya caturthaṃ tailabad āsīcyam*. Of course it is the *caturtha*, it's the fourth, but the—it's actually the *turīyātīta*. It is that transcendent state which is not um a separate state but which pervades all the others, even the waking state, dreaming, even in dream. So um *turīyātīta* is—once—one has reached that high level of consciousness, it is pervading all other states.

*unmiṣat—*yeah, at the point of unfolding. At the point of unfolding—this is not so, it's a process. So, first he enters into *turīya* and then *turīyātīta*, the—the absorption into uh first *turīya* and then *turīyātīta*. *āsādayati*—He reaches that. *acirāt*—It doesn't take time. This is no—there's no delay. Now, there are methods which are very time consuming in yoga and uh meditation and you have to spend so much—so many hours in practicing and this that. But here it's no question of time, *acirāt*. 

Then he quotes from the *Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā*:

> *vikalpa haner hanena ekāgryā ekāgryātkramena īśvaratvāpādanaṃ.*

Unfortunately we don't have the whole text here, uh *Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā* and uh commentaries. But this is a very, very important sentence. 

By giving up the *vikalpa* and by one-pointedness—Of course, *ekāgratā* is in all the systems of yoga. Without *ekāgratā* uh you cannot achieve anything. And by one-pointedness, gradually he—he reaches the state of divinity. *kramena īśvaratvāpadam*—He reaches the state of divinity, means he is transformed into divinity.

See, the power of *vikalpa* should never be underestimated, both in a negative and in the positive sense. But if you had only once that experience of a thought-free state, it is something extremely powerful and uh uh—as I always mention, Abhinavagupta gives us many examples, many possibilities of uh experiencing that. 

And then he quotes the Keneśī, gives the Spāṇḍakārikā—Thank you. So *vikalpa*—sort of negative—

No, we have already uh talked about that. There is also *śuddhavikalpa*. So, you can use *vikalpa* in order to—it's like homeopathy, you know? You use the same thing in order to overcome it um because, you know, in the *Abhinavabhāratī* Abhinavagupta says *nāṭyaṃ vikalpasamvedanam*. So here, uh if it is used negatively, then uh well um the way to attaining that at—in the—in the field of art of course you need *vikalpa*. But *vikalpa* is also imagination. Without imagination you cannot have anything artistic, uh any art uh form. That is quite clear. And uh and on the spiritual path we have *śuddhavikalpa*. You have a pure thought uh which uh like *ahaṃ śivohaṃ* or something like that. Definitely *vikalpa* we can—we don't live without *vikalpa*. But if you want to reach that highest level of consciousness, then it has to be *nirvikalpa*. And this is that very famous phrase from the *Spāṇḍakārikā*. Um I'm reading the whole verse.

> *nicāśuddhyāsamātaseā kart karttavyeṣv abhilāṣinā yadākṣobapralīyate, tadasyāt paramaṃ padam*

When—Now, *kṣobha* is uh—*kṣobha* means agitation. When the agitation of that empirical individual who is incapacitated by his own impurity and is attached to actions disappears, then the highest state appears. 

Now, this *kartaavyeṣv abhilāṣinā* is a um—if I translate this also in a modern way, I would call it workaholic. Those who are completely uh attached to their, you know, they—they can't exist without being active, totally um identified with their activities, the kind of workaholics. But this just—he quotes this second line: The moment this agitation ceases, their highest state occurs, or highest state is attained. 

> *yadākṣobapralīyate, tadasyāt paramaṃ padam*

For the psychologists among you, I have just now finished an article on *kṣobha* for a volume on emotions that—which they are going to bring out from the Simla Institute. Because *kṣobha* also, like everything has—as you say, everything has a positive and a negative aspect. This *kṣobha* which is so disturbing—agitation, disturbance um uh this perturbation, etcetera. But even there there is a positive. There is no creativity without *kṣobha* also. That's why in the field of art you cannot apply the same um—But this is the very frequently quoted—So, here again you'll see, well, it's easy to see: When the disturbance uh ends, the highest state appears. But how does it happen? He doesn't give the means, yeah.

Is there no distinction between *nirvikalpa* and the highest state, or there's—

So I mean, thought-free is the highest state. Right. Or, I mean because there can still be a sort of dualistic thought-free state.

No, no, no, no, no, that by definition it would not be dualistic. No, no. That I mean dualistic thinking is precisely linked to *vikalpa*. So, the moment this—as you say, this uh dualistic uh distracting um thought ends, you are in the *nirvikalpa* state. There is no—

Is there—Is there a distinction between thought and conceptuality? Which duality? Thought and conceptuality? 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But because there can still be conceptuality without thought.

You're saying, is there a distinction between thought and conceptuality. 

No. So, in this system, no, there—No, this is—it is the same. You cannot have any conceptuality without *vikalpa*. But here because he quotes this uh line, so *vikalpa* is identified with *kṣobha*. *Kṣobha* is something—Disturbing, something agitating, no? And as you say, it also—it also means doubt, something which agitates you. 

But when he quotes this line, it also means we are at the highest level of *śāmbhava* here, that these things can happen spontaneously. So, even people are so disturbed and if something, you know, suddenly uh brings them to a state of uh *śama*, to peaceful state, it can happen suddenly without any effort, without any means, etcetera. And that is why it is *śāmbhava*. At the other levels of *upāya*, of course you have to do something, you have to practice, etcetera. But there are spontaneous uh moments of uh—I wouldn't even call it enlightenment, but freeing you from that agitation and uh which—well, the—the *Vijñānabhairava* also gives examples, so you are very agitated or very disturbed, but certain things, you know, and you can go out in nature and suddenly um this whole disturbance uh disappears. So—Huh—

Yes. Yeah, yeah. Of course, this attaining the supreme state um it is something really related to uh *śāmbhava upāya*. 

Then he quotes uh from this *Jñānagarbha*, that is a tantra which is lost, or at least it is not published—*vihaya*—*sakalā kriyā jananī mānasī sarvatu vimuktakaraṇā kriyā anusṛti pāratantrya uccid ucchvalam sthites vat anubhāvatā sapadi vedyati sāparā taśā dhṛpyer atadandhṛtā asama sukāmṛtasyāndinī*.

So, like in the tantras is always Śiva addressing the Devī, or—

> *man renounce all mental activities and are poised in a pure state, being free from the bondage of the pursuit of sense activities*—*vihaya sakalā kriyā*—*giving up all activities*—*mānasī kriyā*—*mental activities*—*vimuktakaraṇā kriyā anusṛti pāratantrya ucchvalam*

> *And being free from the—the activities of the senses, from the dependence of—the bondage of the sense activities, then by thy grace*—means of the Devī, of the Śakti—*vat anu* um *sthites vat anubhāvatā sapadi vedyati sāparā taśā*—*He suddenly realizes that supreme state at once, which rains down the nectar of undiminished and unparalleled happiness.* 

This uh image is found also in yoga texts, you know, that *amṛta* which uh pours down uh from above through the body and uh it is the grace of the Devī, the grace of the Śakti, that um affects this pouring down of the nectar uh blissful nectar, *asamā sukāmṛtasyāndinī*. So, it is connected with the being free from the *kalpa*, free from uh sense uh perceptions, etcetera. 

This is the first—first *upāya*, *vikalpakṣaya*, the dissolution of thought.

> *And because this is predominant in this tradition*—*āyaṁ ca upāya mudaniyatvāt prativijñāyāṁ pratipāditatvāt ādau uktaḥ*—*It has been mentioned first because it has been taught predominantly in this prativijñā tradition.* 

Because *prativijñā*, as we have said repeatedly, is not a practice which requires effort. It is nothing um connected with effort, and also not connected with time. That you have to practice so many hours and weeks and months and so on. Nothing connected with time. It is something which can happen suddenly. So, this is the most fitting means for *prativijñā*.

Now, number two, *Śaktisaṁkocavikāsaḥ*—as these are, of course, two—*Śaktisaṁkoca* and *Śaktivikāsa*. 

So, this pair of *Saṁkocavikāsa* is a kind of the *leitmotif* for the entire text. In different meanings: positive, negative, practical application in uh practice, etcetera.

*Śaktisaṁkoca*—*Śaktisaṁkoca ādaya astu yadyapi prativijñāyāṁ na pratipāditāḥ tathāpi āmnāyikatvāt asmāpi prasaṅgāt pradaśayanti*—*pradaśayanti*—Although these methods are not exactly connected with *prativijñā*, but still he gives some more uh means to give more chances to people to realize that, those who are not capable of that sudden enlightenment—*bahuśu hi pradaṛśiteṣu kaścicit kenacit pravek pravekṣyati*. 

Now, and this is something which is again and again also said by Abhinavagupta: Many means are been—have to be taught so that people who have different capacities, different uh abilities uh they can choose the means which is uh fitting to their nature, to their uh stage of—of consciousness, etcetera. So, there that's why so many means are being taught. 

And here also:

> *If many means are described, someone may enter the state of samāveśa through any one of them.* 

So, you have a uh vast choice. And even in these four *upāyas* are—between these four *upāyas*, there are so many means are taught. 

So, the next one is *Śaktisaṁkoca*, the contraction of energy. And this um—without remembering that this verse has already been quoted, but in the morning I quoted—I mentioned this verse from the *Kathopaniṣad*, and here it comes: 

> *indriyadvārayena prasarantyā eva ākuñcanakrameṇa unmukhikāraṇam*

It means turning inwards gradually by the process of withdrawal—*ākuñcanakrameṇa unmukhikāraṇam*—turning the senses inwards—*indriyadvārayena*, through the senses. 

Now, this is of course a method which is more fitting to the Vedānta and it is very much based on the Upaniṣads. But this is—it is always possible, you can use any other—any method. As it is said in the *Kathopaniṣad* which belongs to the *Atharvaveda* Upaniṣads:

> *parāñci khāni vyatṛṇat svayaṁbhūḥ tasmāt parāṅ paśyati nāntarātman kaścicit dhīraḥ pratyagātm an ātmāna aikṣat āvṛtat cakṣuḥ cakṣur amṛtatvam aśnan aśnan*—*The Self-existent*, that is Brahman, the creator, *pouring the senses outward so that one looks outward and not within*—*antarātman*—*not towards the inner Self*. *But a particular sage*—*kaścicit dhīraḥ*—*desiring the direct experience of the Self, turned his gaze within and discovered*, found *immortality*—*amṛtatvam aśnan*. 

So this is uh—as I said in the morning, this is the, you know, Upaniṣads, the turning point from this external exteriorization to interiorization. And the *Śaktisaṁkoca* means that contraction of the energy—of course, of the senses, contracting in the sense of turning within—*prasiddhāyā api vā*. 

And then the example is uh very frequently given: 

> *kūrmaṅgasaṁkoca saṁkocabhat drāsasamaye hṛtpraveśa praveśabhat sarvato nivartanam*—*This is like a tortoise drawing in its limbs at the moment of danger*.

And this tortoise drawing in uh the limbs is very frequently given example for this drawing of the senses from the objects in—in yoga—*kūṛmavat*. And entering in the heart—*hṛtpraveśa*, entering in the heart—*accha*.

Yes. 

As it is said, 

> *tat āpūryate nityoditā sthitiḥ*—By withdrawing, there is the state, the—which is ever arisen, which is ever present, the ever present state.

Now, the second one is uh *Śaktivikāsa*, and we are not going to do the whole sutra because these are very important practices. But just we end with *Śaktivikāsa*, and the rest we do tomorrow. There are only 20 sutras, so we can uh manage tomorrow.

*Śaktivikāsa* is of course more the tantric method. *Śaktisaṁkoca* is more the Vedāntic method or the Upaniṣadic method. But *Śaktivikāsa*—

> *antar nikuñcāya akrama eva sakala karaṇacakra vispāra vispāraṇena*—See, this is the typical tantric method, means throwing all the senses outside. And it is more difficult in a sense, because this simultaneity of throwing the senses outside without losing your inner uh stability. This is the tantric method. Simultaneous opening of all the sense organs—*akrama*. 

And there are examples in the *Vijñānabhairava*. The simultaneity—it requires a lot of intensity and uh also real that *bala* that he has spoken of, the power, that power and intensity to uh open all the senses without losing your inner—inner uh being—*vispāra*. 

And here this is uh comes both in the tantra loka and in the this aim of Abhinava gupta: and the—

> *lakṣya bahirdṛṣṭi nimeṣonmeṣa varjita*—keeping your aim fixed within, but drawing your—your gaze outside, uh being uh free from—yes, without moving your eyelids, without closing your eyes. 

This fixed gaze, you know, some yogis have that, because small children have it. Small children have that fixed gaze, you know, which is also not focusing. And the yogis also—*anta lakṣya bahirdṛṣṭi*. So that *lakṣya*, that goal, is firmly fixed within. But the gaze is outside. And that is called *bhairavī mudrā*. It is *mudrā*, very high state of—that's why when you see uh saints or photos of saints with open eyes and you can still perceive that—well, I like this photo very much, because here Śāmbhavī is definitely—is within, and yet with open eyes. It is in-between state, completely withdrawn and yet with open eyes. This is called *bhairavī mudrā*. 

And then I will end with this quotation, which is one of my absolute uh loved quotation, which also Kṣemarāja—luckily I have some favorites together with Kṣemarāja because he quotes it in different texts—from one *kakṣyā stotra*, where I still have to get the whole text. It is unpublished—

> *sarvaśakti cittasya darśanāya darśanādyāḥ  svesve vedye yogapatyena niś uh viśvak kṣiptvā madhye hāṭaka staṁbha bhūtā tiṣṭan tiṣṭante na tiṣṭan viśvadhārā eko avabhāsi*—Throwing by will—*citta sa*—All the powers, *śakti*, like seeing, etcetera—*darśanādyāḥ*—simultaneously and on all sides into their respective objects—*svesve vedye yogapatyena niś niśvak*—This is the most difficult—Throwing all the senses into—simultaneously into their respective objects. Very powerful act of precisely not introversion but complete extroversion. But—*kṣiptvā*, throwing. And this root *kṣip* is often used in the uh *vigyana bhairava*—Throwing one's awareness. It's something very quick, some quick uh—not—not a slow process. Throwing your attention, throwing your awareness on uh concentrating on something. Throwing you—And at the same time—*madhye hāṭaka staṁbha bhūtā*—Being established in the center like a pillar of gold—Like a golden—What is the golden pillar? It's the *suṣumṇā*. It's the *madhyanādhi*. But being established in the center like a pillar of gold. It's a very powerful image. You—You, means Śiva, alone appear as the foundation of the universe—*viśvadhārā eko avabhāsi*. Of course, the pillar of gold is Śiva. But in the yogic body is the *madhyatamā*. 

So this is a very powerful—You can meditate on this again and again and you'll discover something very, very powerful. Yes. 

Is that as a kind of uh when we uh in meditation, during meditation, according to—and—and this message—So, is that something like—at that moment, so the subject is object and object is subject? Something like that. Yes. Yes, isn't it? 

Yes. Yes, I think so.

Thank you. Uh this state is only possible in *suṣumṇā* state, like uh in just only in the *suṣumṇā* state when you are in—

Well, you can give it different interpretations. It's not uh—See, this *hāṭaka staṁbha*, this golden pillar uh as I said, it is both the divine, but that presence of the divine in your body is in that *madhya*—*madhyanādhi* uh. There's no other uh interpretation, I think. 

Yeah, so these are really two apparently opposite means. One is withdrawing the senses within and the other is throwing them outside and into their respective objects, but remaining firmly rooted within, which is much more difficult. It's much easier to close your eyes and uh remove all these objects from your sense perception. But this is—this is the tantric way. This is the tantric way.

So, if one day you have an experience of this golden pillar, then it—please let me know. Okay, we stop here. And so tomorrow we'll complete the other means. But it's important to go a little slowly here.
