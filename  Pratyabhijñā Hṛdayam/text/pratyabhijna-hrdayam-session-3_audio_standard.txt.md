## The Microcosm of the Divine: Exploring Consciousness, Contraction, and the Role of Māyā

> **Namaḥ śivāya** śataṃ pañca-kṛtvo vidhāya cānanda-ghana-svātma-parātmā-vibhāsi. 

Shiva is the giver. Shiva is the eater. Shiva is this whole world. Therefore, whether in words, in things, or in thought, there is no state that is not Shiva. 

And this is not only from, uh, Spanda Kārikā, it is in many Tantras, several Tantras this phrase comes. 

Before we come back to our text, is it on? 

Yeah. 

I want to explain to you why I have kept this photo of Shiva here. He is not from India, but from Vietnam. So first of all, you can imagine how far Shaivism, not only Buddhism, but Shaivism also has spread to all these countries: Cambodia, uh, Indonesia, Vietnam. And there is, uh, there are many other such sculptures in Vietnam. I've never been there, but I've heard. He's now in the museum in Paris. 

And I keep him as a model for meditation. 

Originally, he had 10 hands, of which only two are now preserved in their, uh, original position. And he is a model for meditation, and even in this broken form, one hand, the right hand, is still in meditation on his right knee. The left upper raised hand is holding the skull bowl, but I interpret it as one hand is going within in meditation, the other is going out. So that is supporting, upholding whatever we gain in meditation has also to reach outside, as we have seen that whole idea of *bodhicitta*, that it has to be used or made fruitful for upraising the world. 

His whole body is filled with *prāṇa*, and you can feel, if you just sit before it, that this is a *prāṇa* which is completely stilled. There is no movement. It is stilled. The body is only a body of *prāṇa*. 

And his third eye - we just have had a seminar Netra Tantra, that is the Tantra of the third eye of Shiva. His third eye is that which gives you clarity of insights and which makes you overcome all duality.

And the snakes are very lively. They are very lively, but, and they make a knot at this heart chakra. But those very living snakes, they cannot disturb his stillness of meditation and his centeredness. 

And of course, you can also discover the chakras. I'm not going into this. 

And, uh, the half moon is, of course, above the *sahasrāra*. And, uh, it doesn't have a, uh, *jaṭāpaṭ*, uh, crown, which, um, again, that chakra which goes above *sahasrāra* is *dvādaśānta*, external *dvādaśānta*. 

And of course all the deities and, uh, enlightened beings are sitting on a lotus, but we have to take it very seriously. Sitting on a lotus means on the seat of purity. Lotus is a symbol of purity. So that is the *āsana*. *Āsana* is purity, and then this whole energy of *prāṇa* rising up, not with any movement, but in complete stillness and with these two hands which, um, somehow bridge the inner and the outer. 

You can have a look more closely, uh, and just meditate on this image. 

Now, you may be feeling, uh, a kind of contradiction that you have been told that this, uh, way of recognition is an easy path and, um, it leads to sudden enlightenment. And now you find yourself confronted with such a difficult text which, uh, does not seem, uh, to be that *sokopaya* which you have been, uh, expecting. But, um, what is the pedagogy of Kṣemarāja and of all the, um, great authors of this tradition is that you are led from the lowest to the highest. And nothing is left out. 

And this is precisely the Tantric path. That, that's why you have this list of the 36 *tattvas*. No level is left out, but it has to be not transformed, but, uh, experienced as pervaded by that divine consciousness. That's why, um, Shiva is pervading all the *tattvas* from the lowest to the highest. 

And, um, these, uh, *sūtras* and commentaries which we have read so far, of course they also have to integrate whatever, uh, burden they have inherited from the Tantras. So they cannot, uh, leave all that out, but have to reinterpret it in the light of non-dual, uh, philosophy, non-dual experience. 

And these *sūtras* and the reflections are a preparation for this disclosing, and always this image of opening the eyes, *unmeṣa* or *unmīlana*, that disclosing of that secret of recognition. 

And the analysis of these structures, whether they are in the universe or in the human consciousness, are essential to understand what is obstructing us and what is hindering us from this sudden enlightenment. 

Now, for those who have the book, um, I just mention because we don't have time to go into such details. But, uh, there is a table, uh, with these yesterday there on Page 130 in, uh, Jaideva Singh's book, very useful, uh, table of the seven-level levels of perceivers, or with their corresponding experience, corresponding deity, and, and so on. So that you can, uh, those who have the book, they can go through it, um, to come back to that. 

But we cannot go back to Sūtra 3 because we have a lot, um, to cover in these few days. But the last, um, I would just come back to the last sentence of the commentary on Sūtra 3. 

I have this such a small print of Sanskrit, so I made an enlarged photocopy for you. 

**Apitu śrī-parama-śiva-prathārakā eva etad nānā-vaicitrya-sahasreṣu prati.**

What is our problem in this, um, path to enlightenment? Our problem is this: what are we doing with all this multiplicity? The world is so full of multiplicity. And how to integrate this into, uh, a unitary experience. And this is precisely what he says here. After going through all these stages and levels of, uh, perceivers and, uh, uh, l-levels of consciousness, this is at the level of *paramaśiva* who transcends all these 36 *tattvas*. 

Um, just a moment. 

All the… this is another translation. All the entities exist only in the form of that light of consciousness, and the multiplicity… what does he say? What this practically amounts to is that in actuality, the highest blissful Śiva alone manifests himself in this way in numerous forms of multiplicity. 

So this is where it, it comes to that all this multiplicity, it is not negated, but it is seen in the light of that divine consciousness. 

And then the little phrase of introduction to the next *sūtra*: **Yatā cā bhagavān viśva-śarīraḥ tathā**.

Now, as the Lord has the universe as His body, even so. And then follows the *sūtra*. And the same way, **citta-saṁkocāt sa cetano 'pi saṁkucita-viśva-viśvamayaḥ.** Now here comes one, um, very important term. That is a pair, there are many pairs of terms by which you can understand the whole of Kashmir Shaivism. One of these pairs is *saṁkocā-vikāsa*, doesn't matter, but afterwards, I'll read. *Saṁkoca, saṁkocātma*, and the opposite is *vikāsa*. *Saṁkoca* means contraction, constraint, contraction, and *vikāsa*, opening, unfoldment, uh, expansion. 

So these are basically the two, uh, sections of the *Parātriṁśikā-vivaraṇa*. One relates to *saṁkoca*, the state of contraction of consciousness, and then we are led to that *vikāsa*, that unfoldment and that, um, expansion of consciousness. 

And there is a *sūtra* which is my favorite *sūtra*, but you have to be a little patient to wait for that, which is precisely where this *vikāsa* starts, where this opening of the heart starts. 

And, um, before we go into this *sūtra* and the commentary which is very important, I want to quote from Abhinavagupta, the great master of Kṣemarāja, which, uh, a verse which is in the *Parātriṁśikā-vivaraṇa*, uh, which shows how liberal these thinkers were. 

> **“Saṁkocayanti hṛdayam na hi śāstra-pāśā no saṁvidam ghalu śayed yatayāñcalokaḥ, saṁyak svabhāva-padavī-paripūrṇa-rūpā sā eva ullasad layavarā-parītā sthita syāt.”**

It's very poetical also. The bonds of *śāstras* cannot constrict the heart. Nor can this world contaminate consciousness. So neither the religious bondage nor the worldly, societal bondage can constrict the heart. May there be the state of absolute fullness filled with absorption, flashing forth the true natural path of the essence of plenitude. 

So this is, uh, beautiful because he clearly expresses it's not that we have to renounce the world and turn to the *śāstras*. No, the *śāstras* can also be very restrictive and, uh, constraining. We know many religious people are so under this, you know, so many rules to observe, and this is also constraining the heart. So he says it very clearly, even the *śāstras* can be, uh, a burden. But it is a matter of attaining that fullness of consciousness. 

Now coming to our *sūtra*. **citi saṃkoca ātmā cetanopi saṃkoca tā** so he he plays um with two words *saṃkoca* and *citi cetanā*. That is different stages of uh aspects of consciousness uh which there will be one *sūtra* with all these aspects of consciousness from the absolute down to the individual. The individual experience also. 

Now, in this state in whom *citi* or consciousness is contracted, has the universe as his body in a contracted form. **saṃkoca viśva mayā**. And in a more um meaningful translation, we who are a limited consciousness are microcosm of that universal consciousness in a contracted form. 

So our body is a microcosm of that universal consciousness body of Śiva. And we are going to listen, maybe not today or tomorrow, there is this *stotra* by Abhinavagupta, uh, they have that deity, that *cakra stotra* is him to the deity is uh residing in one's own uh body. And there every part of the body is uh presided over by one deity and uh is praised and is offering worship, etc. 

So the difference between Śiva and ourselves is only this *saṁkocā*. We are the same universal being, but in a contracted form. *saṃkoca saṃkoca ātmā*.  And the difference is here between *citi* and *cetanā*. *citi* as we know from the first *sūtra* is that absolute universal consciousness, and then when it comes down to the level of the conscious being, it becomes *cetanā*. *cetanā* is an embodied consciousness, so to say. But even this is *viśva mayā*, is universal in a contracted form. 

So what uh we say that actually, we are uh on the way to certain enlightenment, but that sudden enlightenment also there are stages of making us realize this universal nature, which is our own very own nature. And one of the stages is precisely to understand that our body is a microcosm of the universal divine body. 

This is a tremendous… What a different attitude to the body and, um, of course, to consciousness. 

Now, **śrī paramaśiva svātma eva svātmā ekena citam viśvam sadāśiva ādi ucyatena rūpeṇa ava bibhāśa  ava bibhāśa iśu.** Now, this is a very long compound which I'm not going to burden you with, but then there comes one sentence, we are going to translate everything: **prakāśa bedena prakāśa mānatayā  sphūrati  tathā cit rasa āśyanatā rūpa aśeṣa tatva bhavana bhāva  tat tat pramātre ādi ātmā um  tayā ātmātayāpi prathate.** 

The magnificent highest Śiva desired to manifest the universe, which lies in him as identical with himself, in the form of *Sadāśiva*, so that it comes down to that *tattvas* and other appropriate forms flashes forth at first as non-different from the light of consciousness, but not experiencing the unity of consciousness. Of which… 

Now, this is another state. *Anāśita Śiva* is um uh isolated Śiva who is not connected with the *tattvas*, and uh he is disconnected, so to say. And being is yet more void than the void. *śūnya atiśūnya*. It is uh this one stage of void which is um *śūnya* alone is sometimes the lower *śūnya* that go through a phase of emptiness, which is not the highest *śūnya*. Then comes *śūnya atiśūnya*, that void voider than the void, which is that absolute void, in a sense. 

Um, then he unfolds himself in the totality of manifestation principles, worlds, entities etc. And their respective experiences are only a solidified form of *cit*.

Now, this is a beautiful conception of Kashmir Śaivism. What are these material things? What are they in relation to consciousness? They are something like a… You have water and ice. They are a congealment or a crystallization of consciousness. Or or sugarcane juice and crystallized sugar. So the crystallization of consciousness. 

So what… We have already said that this whole philosophy and spirituality is very fluid, very dynamic, and that what *rasa* is so important, not only in aesthetics and in spirituality, in all uh fields. *Rasa* means that essential uh the essence or the juice, and that um always in a joyful sense. 

Now, what is this universe with all these objects in the universe? They are nothing but congealment or a crystallization of consciousness, *cit rasa āśyanā*. 

There is one *śloka* which uh Swamiji has taught us to recite, uh which is praising Bhairava in the form of the world. Is the same theme like here, who has taken form in as congealment of consciousness. So it's this descending of the divine into the world, into the objects, into the materiality, by congealing that essence, making solidifying it. 

And I wish that if there are any scientists among us, what in modern physics know uh I have just read, because I'm very ignorant about uh uh science, but in quantum physics, I read one sentence of a famous German uh quantum physicist, saying there are no… There is no solid matter. So, it is all uh… I wish if anyone of you knows physics. So, it's a tremendous bridge, you know, to the dialogue with uh modern science. 

Nothing is um just solid matter, but everything is a congealment, in our terms, of that essence of consciousness. For the physicist, they will express it in different terms, energy and this and that. So, this is a… This gives us a clue to bridging that matter, spirit, matter, energy, and so on. 

So there's nothing like simple matter or solid matter. But of course, to realize this, it's okay to read it or to make a statement like this. But to experience it, once you have identified yourself with that consciousness, once you experience that consciousness, and then you see it in all the objects, you like… we go into nature and uh, of course, nature is much easier than uh if you look at uh a factory or some very ugly uh place in a modern city, you have to accept that this is also a congealment of consciousness, but I mean, a very uh… I mean, descended down to a very low level. 

But nature… you meditate in nature, and you can experience that. And every every uh fragment, every leaf, every piece of stone, or everything. So from the apparently solid nature of stone to uh Śiva, that there's no break. It is a fluid flowing down. And then if your consciousness is awakened, flowing up, making all this universe… 

What is our role in practicing spirituality? It's not just to be very happy that “I am… Now, I will be liberated no time.” and so on. But we are there to transform the world. So if our consciousness is transformed, the world will also be transformed. 

And that is, um, it… it is not something isolated, but it connects us with the whole of reality. And because our body itself is that microcosm of the divine macrocosm, and then you experience it in your body, experience it in nature, and in the uh outside world. 

So this is a very important step to realize this. The difference between Śiva and ourselves is only this *saṁkoca*. So you have *saṁkoca*, being interpreted as… less… I can't hear. 

*saṁkoca… saṁkoca* can also be interpreted as hesitation? 

*saṁkoca* can also be uh uh… translation as justification. So is *saṁkoca*…

No, no, no. It is contraction. No, there's another word, *kṣobha*. I have just written an article on *kṣobha*, that is uh good for psychologists. I can give you a copy. 

Uh no, no. *saṁkoca* means contraction, means um uh yeah, constraint or um limitation. So you're not making full use of that consciousness which is given to you. So, you… you limit it to um… or you are constrained by society, by um education, I must also say, uh by so many things, you are constrained, that heart is constrained and it cannot bloom as Kṣemarāja says about Abhinavagupta having made his heart bloom. 

So now he goes on with this theme of the microcosm of the body, which means that the body is divine. 

Um and Sancha is now reading the… the translation: **As thus the Lord is universe bodied, *viśva śarīram***, is this, is um… So, the individual experience, also, because of consciousness being contracted, has the body of the entire universe in a contracted form, even just as the banyan tree is in a contracted form in its seed. 

Now, here, this… this comparison or this uh metaphor comes in the *Parātrīśikātantra*. **yatanyāgrotabījāstā.** But there, that seed is a uh stands for the *bīja mantra*. But that image or that metaphor is used very often for the divine consciousness that it is in such like… is in a *bindu*. It is just in a uh concentrated form, but that has the potentiality of growing into that huge banyan tree with so many branches and uh leaves and so on. So that seed is so tiny, but it has that whole potentiality of a universal um expansion. And potentiality also, of course, in Sanskrit, *śakti*. Like in the *Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa*, it is said it has that power in… 

So, there are two images which are used in the Tantras. One is the seed of the banyan tree, and the others is the egg of the peacock, *mayūrāṇḍa*. Because in the egg of the peacock, it is uh uh just some plasma is there, and you can't distinguish anything. And out of that plasma, that beautiful peacock with so many colors and forms and movements uh comes out. 

So in that way, that divine consciousness, it contains everything in a contracted, uh concentrated form, and then it expands uh as the that universal um body. 

Now, he quotes from a *siddānta*… *siddānta* means from the Āgamas which uh… Let me see. 

**विग्रहो विक्रही चैव सर्वविग्रहविक्रही**

Now, sometimes there's seems… or it's not completely satisfactory because the subject of the sentence is Śiva. It's not said, but it is Śiva. He is the body, the *विक्रही*, the one who who possesses the body and the soul and the soul of all the bodies. **सर्वविग्रहविक्रही** It comes from an Āgama. 

And then he quotes from… Of course, the Tantras are full of texts about this microcosm, macrocosm. It's already in the Upaniṣads, but in the Tantras it is expanded uh to a much greater extent that relationship between microcosm and macrocosm. 

Now, in the *Triśirobhairava*, that is a… a lost Tantra, it is said… Now here, the… there is an emendation which on that Jadish did not know, but it has been emended. Those who know Sanskrit, please emend it: instead of *sarvadevāmayākāya*, it should be **sarvatattvamayākāya**,  **taṃ ca idānīṃ śruṇu priye pṛthivī kaṭhinatvena prabhūtvāmbha prakīrtitaṃ** *Priyam* is uh… in the Tantras there's always a dialogue between Śiva and Śakti, Śiva and Devī. So, he addresses uh the other one. Uh… **This body consists…** Well, there is a conception that the body consists of the Gods, but the example he gives is clearly speaks of the *tattvas*. This body consists of all the *tattvas*, and this even in Ayurveda, many um uh that um the body consists of the *tattvas*. It is a common understanding in Ayurveda because the five cosmic elements and the *pañca* uh *pañcatattva* uh *pañcabhūtaśarīra*, that is a very common understanding of the body.  

So, **this body consists of all the elements, like…** and then he gives an example. **What is solid in the body comes from the earth element, what is liquid comes from the water element.** This is very clear, it's very Ayurvedic uh understanding of the body. Uh, but this is uh unfortunately that uh quotation is only the beginning and the end, and the end is: **triśirobhairava sākṣāt vyāpya viśvaṃ vyavasthitaḥ** The three-headed Bhairava is present himself pervading the entire universe. And this is the end of that passage which he quotes. 

**Triśirobhairava sākṣāt vyāpya viśvaṃ… viśvaṃ vyavasthitaḥ** He is present in… Sorry. **ity anena grantena grāhakaś ca saṅkucita viśvamayatvaṃ vyaṅharati**

Now, um… **ayāṃ ca āśayā.** This is the intent, or this is the meaning. **Grāhakopī ayaṃ prakāśaikātmyena uktāgamayojyatā ca viśvaśarīraśivaikarūpa eva** Even the… the individual being, *grāhaka*, even the individual being, um… because he is one with the light of consciousness, *prakāśaikātmyena*… According to this Āgama he… **viśvaśarīraśivaikarūpa**… He is one with Śiva who has a cosmic body. 

**kevalam tanmāyaśaktyā**… only because of the power of *māyā*. 

Now, *māyāśakti* is the power of differentiation. It's not the Vedāntic *māyā*, but it's the power of differentiation. That is where we are in a dualistic um understanding, and it's only beyond *māyā* that you can uh… you enter into that non-dualistic um understanding of consciousness. And due to the power of *māyā*, he is uh… This is not his unity, his uh oneness with Śiva is not manifested, and it is contracted, *saṅkucita*. only because of his *māyāśakti*, means Śiva's *māyāśakti*, uh… he… The experience appears as contracted because its real nature is not manifested. 

**Contraction also…** Now, this is very important. **Saṅkocopi vicāryamāṇā cit-aikatmyena prathamānant- prathamānatvāt cinmāyā eva**

Now, this is… this is real Kashmir Śaivism. Kashmir Śaivism means not only Advaita. It means *Paramadvaita*. *Paramadvaita* means a non-dualism which does not exclude anything, even dualism. It does not exclude anything, even what is opposed to it. It does not try to defend or uh say, "No, no, no, this is wrong." Nothing is wrong. 

So, even this *saṅkoca*, even this contraction, *saṅkocopi*, if you think about it properly, *vicāryamāṇā, cit-aikatmyena* because it is one with pure consciousness predominantly, it is one with pure consciousness. It is nothing but consciousness. So even that contraction itself, it is nothing but consciousness. 

Because *prathamānatvāt*. How does he translate this? Contraction also includes consideration… consists of consciousness only since it is manifested only as of the nature of *citta*, and so on and so on. 

It becomes… **If not, anyathā tu na kiṃcit.** Otherwise it wouldn't be anything. And that *saṅkucita*, uh *saṅkucita*, uh… It would not exist if it were not consciousness. 

Well, here he said in the beginning that you don't need logic, and he's not going to pro- proceed through the method of logic and so on. But he doesn't use philosophical logic here, but he uses spiritual logic, I would call it. So, you have… Because it is all connected with the experience. But still there is a philosophy um lying um underneath, of course. 

**Iti sarvograhāko viśvaśarīraḥ,** therefore all individual experiences are universal or are have this microcosm… microcosmic body which is nothing but *Śivapārākaḥ*. **Iti sarvograhāko viśvaśarīraḥ śivapārākaḥ eva** So that is why the enlightened one, he… he sees in every person he sees the divine. But this is a whole change of vision. 

And then he quotes something which is a bit funny. **Akiyatrayadenākiyate, kiyatir eva avasiṣyate. Kiyaticet kiyatir upatvāt kiyatir evā vasiṣyate.** It's a kind of um logical uh uh play, uh… If non-… I'm reading in a different translation. "If non-manifestation is not manifest,"  "Non-appearance of identity with consciousness."  "Otherwise, nothing remains but consciousness."  "If it does appear, manifestation alone appears." So he's just playing with this *kiyati* and *akiyati*. 

And then he quotes from the Spanda. Can you give me the copy of *Spandakārikā*?  What we have just recited in the beginning. Thank you.  

**Yasmāt sarvamayo jīvaḥ, sarvabhāvasamudbhavat, tat-samvedanarūpeṇa tādarthātmya prati- pratipattiḥ tasmāt śabdārthatacintāsu na sāvasthānayā śivaḥ.**  

Because the *jīva* is… *jīva* means the individual being… is identical with the whole universe and including with… hence whether in word or object or mental apprehension, there is no state which is not Śiva. 

And the full uh… First verse is… Since the limited individual self is identical with the whole universe, in as much as all entities arise from him, *sarvabhāvasamudbhavat*… And because of the knowledge of all subjects, he has the feeling of identity with them all, hence whether in word, object or thought, there is no state which is not Śiva. 

**Ityādinā śivajīvayor abhedatā eva uktā** And this expresses the non-duality of the individual and Śiva. 

**Etatattvaparijñānam eva muktiḥ** And the complete knowledge or realization of this constitutes liberation. Complete *parijñānam*. *Pari-*… *Pari* is always all-round *parijñānam*. This complete knowledge, complete realization constitutes liberation. 

**Etatattva-parijñānam eva bandhaḥ.** And bondage is just the ignorance of this fact. 

**Iti praviśati eva etat.** 

Now, we come to the introduction to *sūtra* five. So, it is clear from this sentence also that liberation in this uh tradition of um *Pratyabhijñā* is *gnosis*, is through knowledge, not through ritual, and not even through yoga, but through knowledge. But knowledge, of course, of the highest uh type. 

Now, the introduction to uh *sūtra* five. So he raises uh a question himself. 

**Nanu grāhakoyaṃ vikalpamayaḥ? Vikalpanam ca  cit- cittahetut- hetukam sati saccide katam asya śivātmakatvam? Iti saṃ- saṅkitvā cittameva niraṇitum āhaḥ.** 

The question about mind. An objection may be raised that is… The subject or experience is of the nature of *vikalpa*. Now, *vikalpa* is a very uh crucial term in all the spiritual traditions of… Buddhist or Hindu or yoga traditions… *Vikalpa* is that dualistic or um thought construct, a thought which is not corresponding to reality, but which is an imagination… Um yeah, it is mostly translated as *thought construct*. *Vikalpa* is that which is the greatest obstacle to realization because we always imagine things, even in the spiritual field, you know, we are full of ideas, full of uh thoughts and um uh… which do not correspond to the experience or to the reality.

So if the subject or experience is of the nature of *Vikalpa*, and *Vikalpa* is due to *citta*, now *citta* you can simply translate as mind… *citta* being there, how can he… that means the subject… be of the nature of Shiva? See, the… after all we are so much uh identified with our mind, and our mind is going on making constructions and imaginations and projections and all kinds of things psychologists are there… How is it possible that this being um is of the nature of Shiva?

So then he ans… answers in this *sūtra* 5:

**Cittireva cetanāth avarūḍha avarūha**

So this is a typical play with all the uh levels of consciousness or mind. So, and I… I… this is a… Sanskrit is a wonderful language to um express with the same word same root: *cit, citanat, citta, citi*, etcetera. 

So once you have copied this, I will give you um a list in uh in order. We have started with *citi sva tantra* which was *cited to*, so *citi* is there that ultimate um completely independent uh uh pure consciousness. And then this *citi* descends down through *cetana*… *cetana* is… it is embodied in our conscious being to um to *citta* that is our mind, down to *cetya* that is the object of the mind. The… the… the thing which is *cetya*, which is thought… from uh… if somebody of you knows Krishna Murthy, you know, freedom from the known uh… for freedom from thought, you know… that is from pure consciousness now down to the… the object of thought, *cetya*.

So uh you… you have um 30 things translation, but I give you an alternative: **Mind is none other than consciousness subjected to qualifications, having descended from *citi* to *cetana*…** being… no… no, this is an explanation, this is not the translation, but uh… **Citta… *citta*… mind is nothing but *citi*, nothing but that absolute consciousness which has descended from the stage of *cetana*, from the… from the stage of the conscious being, *avarūḍha*, has come down and has attained the contraction of the object… object of consciousness.**

So these are the… the… in descending order uh… it's very clear in Sanskrit. *Citi*, of course, is uh the same as *cit*, uh there's no difference: that pure consciousness. Then it gets embodied in the conscious being, that is *cetanā*, and um this is that embodiment, that limitation is our mind, *citta*, and… and that mind then manifests in the uh external objects because the mind is precisely that which has *Vikalpa*, which dualizes, is constantly engaged, and we have this um *vasya*, not *grahya grahaka* subject-object dichotomy. This is the… the activity of the mind is always subject-object, subject-object, and *cetya* then is that object of thought. 

Is anything missing? 

**Not *citta nama anyat kim citta*…** that mind is nothing else. 

**Api tu saiva bhagavatī tat…** It is that very lady consciousness, *bhagavatī*, that very goddess… **Mind is nothing else but that very goddess, *citi*.**

And um… but later we will see that Kshemaraja, you know, every author or every one of this great masters, they have their favorite uh deity. And when you read the whole text of the *Vati Vidyā Vivṛti*, then his deity is consciousness. He always says *bhagavatī* and *patar pika* and so on. So, he… he… his deity is *citi*, is *cit*, is um… and he doesn't give her any name. And uh… so this is very beautiful, you know, that's uh very uh… he has a very personal relationship with this *bhagavatī*. He says: **citta… Api tu saiva bhagavatī…** This is the same goddess.

Now, **Tatha hi sat svam svarūpam gūpayatvā yathā saṁkuc- saṁkṛṇāti…** but she hides her own nature, this is the whole trouble. She is the same goddess, but she's hiding her own nature um… and that is why she… she takes on contraction because she's hiding herself. 

**Tadā dvy- dvayakati…** and from there comes this duality. That she's hiding her… her own nature. 

**Kathācit ullasitam api saṁkocam guṇīkṛtyā cit pradhānyena sphurati kathācit saṁkoca pradahanatayā…** So she af- after all that goddess is always playful, and that is in the whole um… you read here, remember Empress Jkvari Varna, and he explains *Devī… Devī*, one aspect, one uh meaning of *Devī* is “she is playful.” So like a child in play hides him- or herself, so she is playful. Sometimes she hides her nature. 

So in… in that case, we are not the subject. She is doing it. She is hiding her nature, and that's why we are in contraction. 

So always the problem is that we are always putting our own individual consciousness at the center, but it's not like this. We are in the hands of this goddess consciousness, and she is the one who is doing. She is also hiding herself. So… and by hiding, you know, like children are playing uh hide and seek, sometimes one aspect is predominant and sometimes another aspect is um is hidden and the other is revealed, and the other is uh revealed and the other is hidden. 

**Cit… *citpradhānyapakṣe*…** um when the pure consciousness is predominant… This is the natural state, *sahaja*. **Prakāśamātra pradahanatve vijñāna kalatā…** The case of *cit* being predominant in its natural state and there being the predominance of *prakāśa*, its… its experience is *vijñāna kalā*… here we come back to this seven uh experience… and… But I am not going again uh to this topic which is a little complicated. But when… So different aspects of her consciousness are predominant, which manifest at different stages of consciousness. This is what… what is meant. 

But um… so it again goes through those stages of the uh the higher *tattvas* like *sadāśiva īśa* and so on. But this is very consoling for us… Page 60 uh… Page 60 uh… please follow the text…

**Samādhi prayatnena upārjite tu citpradhānatve śuddhādhvāpramātr̥tā kramātmaka kra- kramāt kramātkramaṁ prakāśa- prakāśavati…** When the dominance of consciousness has been achieved through *samādhi*… Now, *samādhi* is that… *samādhi* means here not only the highest stage of yoga, but meditation. If through meditation you achieve a state of predominance… See, everything is fluid. It's not that you have one fixed state, but there is something, and with your meditation you make this state more and more predominant. That's why we are sitting for many hours in meditation to… to strengthen this level of consciousness. 

Um… when predominance of consciousness has been achieved through *samādhi*, the pure path becomes even greater, that *śuddhādhvā*. Gradually… here *kramātkramaṁ*, that means it's in the course of practice, of practicing *samādhi*, practicing meditation. 

Now, *śuddhādhvā*, the pure path… when you have the 36 *tattvas* up to the level of *māyā*, it is the impure path, and from the *śuddhavidyā*, from the pure wisdom up to *śiva* is the pure path. So once you have crossed *māyā* and entered *śuddhavidyā*, you are in the pure path, and you can only ascend, you cannot descend because uh… that level of *māyā* has been crossed. And that is through the practice of *samādhi*. *Samādhi pradhāniyā samādhi prayatna*… So that is still some effort, *citpradhānatve*.

**Saṁkocapradhā- pradānyatu śūnya śūnyāpramātr̥tā…** but if the contraction is predominant, then uh… it is that… *śūnyapramātā* is a uh… uh… uh… perceiver or a subject at the lower level of *śūnya*, not exactly the higher *śūnya*, but that level of uh unconsciousness… *śūnyapramātā*. 

**Evam avasthite satye cittireva saṁkucita grāhakarūpā cetanāpadārthāvarūḍhā…** Now, this is just repeats the same thing… *Citi* itself in the form of the limited subject, descending from its stage of *cetanā*, disposes towards comprehending objects…

Now here I have a beautiful word which I have translated differently. And… Page 61, for those who know Sanskrit, on the top… **Arthagrahaṇo mukhi sati arthagrahaṇa unmukhi…** She who is directed to grasp objects… And I've translated this as consumerism. 

Because this constantly, you know, wanting to have something, wanting to grasp something uh… *arthagrahaṇa unmukhi* uh… In… in our… the modern form is consumerism because always you want something, you always project something outside, and you want to fill that gap which is in yourself by having more things and um… everything… *arthagrahaṇa unmukhi*. *Unmukhi* means this tendency to possess objects. *Arthagrahaṇa unmukhi*… It's a beautiful, very apt expression.

So if that um… *saṁkoca* is there, that contraction… because then you feel something is lacking. If you are contracted, you always feel something lacking. So, you compensate it by… by grasping objects. *Arthagrahaṇa unmukhi*.

**Citireva Nilasukādinā saṁkucine**… and so on… **upayāsaṁkoca saṁkucitayeva cittan…** And this is the characteristic of the mind which um… This both this… Well um… that if it says this both toward comprehending objects… Not comprehending is grasping… Being limited by its objects of consciousness like blue, pleasure, etcetera… Being limited by both limitations becomes the mind or individual consciousness. 

Then he quotes from the… the… the *Viṣṇudhā svāṅgarūpeṣu*… Here I have another translation… **svāṅgarūpeṣu bhāveṣu patyau jñānaṁ kriyā ca yā māyā tṛtīyete 'pi va paśu sattvaṁ rajaṣtama…** The Lord's knowledge and action with *māyā* is the third. With reference to those things which are his own being become for the *paśu*… *paśu* is the limited individual… his *sattva, raja* and *tamas*. That means the qualities of *prakṛti*. But this um… we cannot go into the interpretation… **Ityādinā svātantrayātma accitte śaktirīva jñānakriyāmāyaśaktirūpā paśudaśāyāṁ saṁkocaprakāśāt sattvara- jaṣtama svabhāvāccitātmātrayā sphuṭate…**

Well, even *jñāna kriyā*, knowledge, activity, and the third *śakti*, *māyā*, of the Lord appear as *sattva, raja* and *tamas* in the case of the *paśu*, the limited individual. So uh… this three *śaktis* of the Lord become the three *guṇas* of *prakṛti* in the limited individual, which are like his limbs, *svāṅgarūpeṣu*. By this and other such statements it is clear that *cittav*, which is of the nature of absolute freedom, which has the powers of *jñāna kriyā* and *māyā*, appears owing to excess of limitation in the state of *paśu*, the individual being, as *citta*, as mind, and so on. 

Now comes a quotation which is one of my favorite in this text. It's very consoling…

**Ātatāyiba to…** This from the um… that *Tattvaprakāśa*, this is a tantric text… The *jñāna*… lost tantric text… 

**Ātatāyiba tu ye kecit paramārthanu- sāriṇā teṣāṁ tatra svarūpasya svadyutiṣṭvaṁ na lupyate…** I'm making a… my own translation… **Therefore, those who are followers of the ultimate reality, *paramārtha anusāriṇā*…** And here it is no qualification. What is that ultimate real…? It is that… those who are following that ultimate reality, *paramārtha*…  **For them there is never any loss of the luminosity of their own nature.** It's very beautiful… **svarūpasya sva- dyutiṣṭvaṁ na lupyate…** Their luminous nature can never be lost.

So it's not uh… uh… statement about people who are already enlightened, but who are following the path of ultimate reality, *paramārtha anusāriṇā*. So, this… so universal, it can be applied in any tradition. *paramārtha anu*… Those who are following that ultimate reality or in search of that ultimate reality… their luminosity of their own nature can never be lost. 

So, this… such a consoling statement, because in your spiritual life, you know… Sometimes you have ups and downs, and when you are down then think, “Oh what happened? And nothing is going on. I'm not experiencing anything.” and so on. No, you cannot lose anything. This is what my guru always said: You cannot lose anything. Once you have touched that, once you have… in search of that ultimate reality, you will never lose… lose it. You may subjectively think that you have lost it, but you have not lost it. This is beautiful. Just note it in your diary.

So, will um… I think finish the sixth *sūtras*, because we have to proceed a little quicker. And this is also not so uh complicated…

**Cittamēvāttu māyāpramātuḥ svarūpaṁ…** The *māyāpramātā*… *māyāpramātā* is that limited individual, limited individual… the… the nature of the limited individual is only mind… *cittamēva*.

Then he says in the *sūtra*: 

**tanmayo māyāpramātā…**

But this is very easy. And it's just the continuation of the previous one. *tanmaya* means that limited uh individual… limited perceiver… He… he… he consist only of that… But this… that refers… that… that… that refers to *citta*. He is nothing but mind. That limitation… limited individual is nothing but mind. 

**Dehaprāṇapadāṁ tāvatcittapadānamēva…** And uh… it is always a question not of um… exclude… exclusively… But what is predominant? What is predominant? If our consciousness is predominantly mind, then we are at the level of *māyāpramātā*. If it is predominantly *cittav*, then we are at the level of the higher consciousness. But here, *cittapadānamēva*… If that mind is predominant uh… at which belongs to the uh level of body and *prāṇa*… Body and vital um energy… *citta* is predominant in the sphere of life and body. *Dehaprāṇapadaṁ*.

**Śūnyabhūmirītyapicittasaṁskāra- patīva…** The sphere of the void also consists of the *saṁskāras* of the *citta*. It is very misleading, this *śūnya*, use of *śūnya* because he mostly refers to a state of… of void which is not the highest, which is a… some in between when you are trying to get out of that limitation and you have not yet reached the higher… So, in between, there is a state of kind of emptiness, or kind of… yeah, better to translate as emptiness maybe uh… 

He also criticizes uh certain yogis, you know, who think that they have entered that state of *śūnya*, but uh in fact they have um uh… They are still there *saṁskāras*, their… their impressions are still there. So, when they get out of *samadhi*, all the same old things are coming up. This is very uh… uh… they have not really crossed that um barrier. 

And um… that is why the question is how *we* look at the individual being: whether as pure consciousness or as mind. And those of you who have done the *Śivasūtras* last year… there are not many uh… There are… in the *Śivasūtras*, in two sections, the mind is uh… with the two levels. It starts, as our *sūtra* one, from the highest level: **caitanyamātmā…** Consciousness is the innermost reality of everything and of the person. And then at the lower level: **cittamātmā…** the um… self is mind. So that is at the level of *māyāpramātā*. Well, of course a long commentary on the *Śivasūtra*, etcetera. But this is just to complete the um whole topic of mind and consciousness and the different stages through which consciousness travels downwards and then mind rises upwards to that pure consciousness.

There's not uh… much time left, and I would uh… if you want to ask some questions, there would be… I think yesterday many questions came up, but they were not expressed… 

*Vikalpa* again… You said *vikalpa* is that one obstruction to uh… once in one's journey… Is *vikalpa* imagination? 

Uh… *vikalpa*… *Vikalpa*… *Vikalpa*, yeah… Could you explain…? You said it is the obstruction… *Vikalpa* is the greatest obstruction in our journey… 

Yes, yes… Yes, yes… It's important question… um… *Vikalpa* uh… We… we don't live without *vikalpas*, um… It's very difficult, I mean uh… to be free from thoughts or imaginations or whatever. So, it's a question… *nirvikalpa*… You reach a state of *nirvikalpa*, the very high level of *samadhi*, and so on and so on. But uh… again there is a… a way out because *vikalpa* is not only an obstruction, it… it becomes also an *upaya*. And uh… I have not talked because the text itself comes there… In Kaśmīra Śaivism, there are four stages of *upaya*, of means to liberation, and it's only at the highest uh… the highest two where you are in a state of *nirvikalpa*, but at the lower stages you have to use *vikalpa* because you have to use your mind and your thoughts and uh… and… and they become um an *upaya*. And the states… the uh… *upaya* where this is most uh practiced is *śāktopāya*, the way of energy. 

And on the way of energy you use what they call *śuddhā vikalpa*, a pure thought. See uh… that is… nothing… “pure” and “impure” has nothing to do with morality. It has to do with the content of the thought. If you practice *śivo'ham* for example, *so'ham*… That is a *śuddhā vikalpa*. So, it can… you can start from the thought, from the content, and use it as a *mantra* or whatever to reach that state of *nirvikalpa*. So, there are other *śuddhā vikalpas* which uh… or your guru gives you um something to… to work on. It may not be only a *mantra*. It may be a um… a word, a sentence, a um… an instruction. 

So that is *śuddhā vikalpa*. And then you work with that. So, you *have* to use your mind. And then by using your mind, you transcend it. 

So that's uh… specially at the level of *śāktopāya*, the way of energy. 

Does anybody… give the mic… Mike… Under the… So, *vikalpa* is both a doubt and thought…

Yes… Yes… Because *vi* means that separation, you know? So um… is it this or is it that? It's always in a… in a stage of um… restlessness kind of, you know? You're not um… not… the focused thought is not *vikalpa*. *Vikalpa* is always something uh… yeah… So that's why it is also doubt…

Any other translation? 

What is the difference between…  the Vedānta… the *Māyā* of Vedānta and *Citi* of Kaśmīr Śaivism… is any difference…? 

Difference between *Citi* as an… *Māyā*… *Māyā*, Vedāntic *Māyā*… 

No, no… Vedāntic *Māyā* means… if you compare with Vedānta, it is *Cit* in Vedānta… *Cit* or *Cidagniyā*… but *Māyā* of Vedānta is not the same as *Māyā* here. Because here, *Māyā*, first of all, is an energy of Lord Śiva, even though she is obscuring, but she is a *Śakti*. She may be obscuring, but it is not like in Vedānta that the whole world is under the sway of *Māyā*, etcetera, etcetera, and *Māyā* is *anirvacanīya*, you can't define her, you can't explain her, and so on. 

Now, here *Māyā* is a stage of the divine energy, but the one who has the power to obscure or to hide, as he says here beautifully, hiding the reality instead of revealing. And then of course, the higher *Śaktis* are there. Yeah, but it's not… not the Vedāntic…

Actually, I'm not quite clear on the question of hiding uh… that uh… that the universal consciousness uh… as opposed to individual consciousness uh… is this… this seductive attraction uh… to explore the ultimate reality, and this is the path uh… that gives you this luminous nature… So is this the hiding in order to make you luminous, to explore uh the ultimate reality? 

No… hiding… I mean, we have… we are reciting this *Mangalaśloka* of the *Pañcākṛtya*. So, hiding is actually one of the acts of Lord Śiva, *Tirodhāna*, and of course the power who is activating all this is his *Śakti*. And his *Śakti* who is both hiding and revealing. So, *Śakti* has always this double aspect, and that is why so much depends also on our um… which aspect of *Śakti* we are uh taking hold of: whether we are consciously living in that hiding and uh concealing, or we are in that revealing uh aspect of *Śakti*.

So, *Citisvatantra* means *svatantra*, freedom… is not only of Śiva, it is also our freedom because if we are that macrocosm of the divine, that freedom is also ours. And that is why I said this is the only philosophy which really has freedom at the central uh… central concept. And so freedom can go both ways. 

Yeah… Is this also to distinguish between those who follow the path of consciousness or they use their consciousness, and those who use their mind, and so it's hidden from those who use their mind? 

Yeah, yeah, yeah… So a lot is left to us, like he said that… if you, with the effort of *Samādhi*, you can um… so there is an effort also at the lower stages, and then once you reach a stage of spontaneity and complete uh enlightenment… that is of course beyond effort. But um… that effort of meditation is there which then refines our mind more and more, makes it more and more subtle and more… more transparent, and then it becomes transformed into that uh pure consciousness. 

This is the whole process. I think uh… we conclude this session.
