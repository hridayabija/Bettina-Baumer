From any path it goes. It is absolutely pure consciousness. And naturally, as they would expect that *jñāna* actually refers to the Shiva sūtras. So the first sūtra, *cetanaṃ ātma*, and as I said the *cetanaṃ ātma* itself is such a universal statement: "Consciousness is the innermost reality of the universe."

So here I am taking *cetanaṃ ātma*. It's a bit more selective, because this is a session on Trika, but it's very important to see that basis for that universality. That which is devoid of all differentiation, super-impositions and separations. That is *upādhi*, and *avacetana*, which is not limited by contraction, *saṃkoca*. *Saṃkoca* is everything which is limited, and the opposite is *vikāsa*, the expansion into the unlimited. It's not limited by contraction, is the form of the nature of consciousness of the subject. That is the essential nature of the Supreme Self, *ātman*, the Supreme Shiva, and not separate as in the doctrine of the dualists.

Therefore, he has—he is of this Shiva. He has expounded the truth of *mātṛ* which is expressed as "I am Shiva", "I am Shiva of quality", "*śivo'haṃ*", "*aham*", "*śivaḥ*", etcetera. So this is the expression for pure consciousness which is not uh subject to any limitation. And this is stated in all the scriptures. But this essence, the secret of non-duality, is not understood by the followers of the dualistic school and so on. So all the scriptures—everything is accepted but dualism. Is not accepted because that contradicts the very concept of everything being consciousness, everything being one, actually with everything else. So that is not possible in non-dualism, *Advaita*.

Then he quotes from the tantric text called *Kulapañcāśikā*, where goddess: "When people start engaging in contradictory assertions such as 'that is', 'that is not', then this understanding is not rooted in the heart." This fighting among the philosophers and different doctrines, therefore the goddess kept it hidden. But, oh goddess, by its realization, what is not attained on this earth, for the individual.

Therefore, it is said in the Shiva Sūtras which are the summary of the entire Shaiva *śāstras*. At the very beginning that consciousness is the nature of reality. *Cetanaṃ ātman*. Okay, now we have to dissect. 

So 29. Oh, goddess, one's own nature is not pure unless it is awakened by the *śakti*. *Yāvat śaktyā na bhūtitam*. So again we come to this same Shiva *tattva*, because that you cannot reach Shiva unless through the door of *Śakti*. So if a yogi thinks that he does not need *Śakti*, he has already attained Shiva. He's already one with Shiva. But just wait for a moment. And that's why in the very concept of *Śaktipāta*, uh it's not just a miraculous thing happening suddenly. But it is necessary. Without *śakti* that state cannot be uh pure. This is pure *nirmalatā* of the deity. *Yāvat śaktyā na bhūtitam*.

So that is why the following verse, following verse after the deity Shiva. Goddess is now coming with *Śakti*. Even at that very high level. So Shiva, of course, first verse is Shiva centric. He's called the *mahesha* and then Shiva. According to the instruction of the *Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra*, and other scriptures, one has to dissolve one's individuality. Entering into one's own effulgence of the limited self which is a reflection of the energy. By means of the energy of the Supreme Lord. Then the nature of the Supreme Shiva bless the individual. *Parameśvara tvam*.

Now, this is very important because what the yogi attains—when it's again and again it says, "He becomes Shiva", but actually he doesn't become Shiva as a specific deity. But he attains the Shivahood. He attains the state of Shiva. Like in Buddhism it is said you have not Buddha, but the Buddha-nature. You have to realize the Buddha-nature. Not Buddha is an individual who has been illuminated. And here also, it is the Shivahood, Shiva *tvam*. 

Then 29th, second half. The self is to be purified by initiation, knowledge and so on. So it looks as if you're going a step down. From the highest state. But this is the normal in English Shaiva scripture, the practitioner has to go through *dīkṣā*, has to be initiated. And *jñāna*, *jñāna* we have already said, this here we are in the realm of *jñāna*. Uh the *Parā-jñāna* is in the realm of of *jñāna*. But *dīkṣā*, there was a chapter on *dīkṣā*, of course, in Chapter Three, but it is not mentioned as a uh necessary condition for going on this upward path, not at all. So why does he now say that unless he is purified, the self is purified by initiation, knowledge, etcetera, and yoga of course. But that purified self is not yet uh the the highest, that which is *cetanaṃ ātman*. So there is the danger of—that you have gone through a whole process of initiation and yoga and *jñāna* etcetera. So you think—now that got clear—this is already—this is—this—this—when we had talked yesterday somebody asked about guru. Of course that's very needed—guru to tell you just wait this is not—you have to still go. So now that—that—that part is uh—because Shivamatra gives it so briefly and obviously it refers to the—such under—that under—because such under—that under puts it in the context of *dīkṣā*. And the context of initiation, so many things are compressed which are absolutely beautiful. I have already mentioned several times that the *vyāpti*—pervasion. So in such under that under he describes a whole series of *vyāpti* of *dehavyāpti*—pervasion of the body, and then *ātmavyāpti*—the pervasion of the self. Pervasion always means with the divine consciousness. *Ātmavyāpti* pervasion is Shiva *vyāpti* after *ātma* but beyond *ātmavyāpti* there is *śivavyāpti*. There is the divine pervasion:

> *bandhanaśeṣabhāvenā sarva tvapadavyacita*

So he has to aim at *śivavyāpti*—pervasion by Shiva. 

> *avetya paramārthatvam śivatvam kalpitam tvayi*
> *tam ātmopāsakaḥ śive na gacchanti paraṃśivam*

Without knowing the supreme reality which is the Shiva nature—if—if they do not know that supreme reality which is nature of Shiva *tattva*, those worshipers of the self, they don't attain the supreme Shiva—*na gacchanti paraṃśivam*. So it is obviously as stated. And it's because in future, you know Shivaraja is recommending both of *Suchaṃdā Tantra* and the *Netra Tantra*. So he's quoting them neutrally. Here in the commentary also quotes the *Netra Tantra*. So that *ātma tattva*, the reality of um—forget about Vedanta here. *Ātma* does not mean the Vedantic *ātma*. It's also mighty, it is said no um—that's a shaman—it's not the—*ātma* means the individual self, that as we use it normally. Not the absolute self. So reaching only the *ātma tattva* without knowing the supreme reality, they will not—they don't attain the state of Shiva. This is just a warning and because this is, of course, a a system where *śakti* and experientially the *śakti* is essential. Without *śakti* there's no connection to Shiva. So that is why it's a warning—even if you have gone to initiation of done all kinds of yoga and etc. But if you have not received that, let us say in English, grace by the divine energy, it is you are attaining Shiva—maybe an illusion. So in that if one—as long as the supreme energy endowed with the attributes of omniscience, etc. has not pervaded the self with a complete pervasion from foot to head, Shiva being pure cannot unfold himself, and so long the self even being pure is said to be bound according to the Shiva tradition. Upat—um from foot to head.

Now you remember the *sūkṣma śarīra*. Because in in the *tantra prakriyā* you start with *kuṇḍalinī* for the big toe. Uh. So the whole body is pervaded by the energy by the *sūkṣma śarīra* of the *tantra prakriyā*. So it seems that uh *sūkṣma śarīra* is again an occult—another—but it is all very spiritual um. It is not philosophy that—because you know there's a contradiction. This is spiritual realities. If one has the illusion to attain Shiva without having had—without the whole body having been transformed by the energy. Then it becomes—we know some of this—some of this uh very high—I don't want to mention anything but it's a very high uh yogis who know but they're very high. It's only knowledge and there's no—not that energy which pervades the whole body. But this is of course *tantra* that is not uh. The other systems which are not emphasizing *śakti*. Even in Shaiva, because even Shaiva Siddhanta though being there, Shaiva Siddhanta does not emphasize *śakti*. 

And so long the self even being pure is said to be bound according to Shaiva tradition. And the Shivaraja says that in the Shaiva tradition it is *śivamukti* which comes. So it is an *jīvanmukti*—liberation in this body in this life—requires *śakti*. There are ways of attaining *mokṣa* which are not aiming at *jīvanmukti* but at *videhamukti*. And here *śakti* is uh essential for being liberated in this world in this body. Because he—and here *śakti* is uh essential for being liberated in this world in this body. He in whom the energy of grace has not been unfolded from the big toe of the foot up to the head by means of initiation, hypnosis, etc. And by merging his foremost *prāṇa* and unfolding the innermost consciousness, as long as the supreme energy who is of the nature of omniscience, omnipotence, and freedom has not expanded, means she has not awakened, so long the self, that is the soul, is not pure. If this is the case, then according to the Shaiva tradition the self is called bound, etc. because it is not qualified for *jīvanmukti*. 

But now this was a kind of parenthesis, a little precaution. Making the yogi cautious uh—even if he has attained that high, but he has to be careful not to be happy money. Not to think himself to have reached unless he has received the grace of *śakti*.

So we proceed 32 to 30 36 AB. That is 32 to 36 AB. The whole—that is—

> *tavān nitarmalohyātmā bandhanaśainivatocyate* 
> *yatrasapuraṣaḥ sarvamvetyavītamagnitam* 
> *sanniyamindiyagramam tattvamśaktilakṣaṇam* 
> *yatrayatrabhavedicchājñānaṁ vāmi pravartate* 
> *kriyākṛtyasarūpāvā tattvamśaktilakṣaṇam* 
> *vyāpakasyayato devī cidrūpasyātmanaḥ śivaḥ* 
> *prasatyadbhutānandasā śaktiparamāsṛtā* 
> *vibhrajyātmatāmānam sarvajñādidguṇairguṇī* 
> *sā sā saktyate devī śivaparamakāraṇam* 
> *sarvajña paritṛptaśca yasyāto jñānabimā*—

next one is—

> *svatantrojjvalarūptaśca yasya jñānaṁ śaktikaḥ* 
> *śaktimān guṇaiḥ etaiḥ sā guṇānvetti guṇī*.

So therefore, as it—as I had said before that *ānanda* is *saṃkoca*—contraction, and all these *vikās*—expansion. And then uh generally because it—*ayaśakti* is always accompanied by that *śakti*. Now he shows the nature, true nature of one whose energy has expanded because it—*ayaśakti* is very good. So we have a similar situation in the uh *sūkṣma vyāyana* where somebody precedes all into a full him to the *śakti*. That therein being established and having controlled the senses, the person knows everything past and future. That reality is of the nature of the energy—instead of person you can put yogi. The yogi knows everything—*sarvavit*—past and future—*atītānāgatam*. So this is a characteristic of a yogi who has been graced by the *śakti*.
