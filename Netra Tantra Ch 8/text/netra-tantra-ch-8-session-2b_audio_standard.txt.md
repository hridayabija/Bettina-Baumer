But in Śākta Veda, if it is related to the energies, this is *kriyā* (activity). And this *jñāna* (knowledge) and this is *uccāra*. So at the level of the Divine play, a pure will—but "will" is again not a good translation—a pure impulse towards the Divine intention, perhaps. 

Intention. "Intention" is also... but "intention" would be, could be also translated by other words in Sanskrit. But intention is also there, yes. Definitely, definitely. 

So now just to situate these four kinds of *samādhi* in relation to these four paths. As I said, without counting them separately, otherwise it will be too complicated. 

So we recite 17:

> Oṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu ātmānaṁ citranigrahaḥ |
>
> samādhānam iti proktaṁ na tathā lokatāṁ dikam || 17 ||

Now what is interesting in two of these four paths? That, as we have had at the beginning of Chapter 7, and also, uh, before that, that *yogin* does not only practice for himself, but also for others. So that intention to to share or to to spread it, um, experience to others and to let them participate in the achievement. 

And *samādhi*—that is always the play with the words also—is also analyzed etymologically. *Samādhāna, samādhāna* is the synonym of *samādhi. Samādhāna*. And *sama* means "equal." Fixing one's mind equally in all beings is called *samādhāna* (absorption). 

Free from mental representation, this is called true *samādhāna*. All else is merely befooling the people, even if the others sometimes have the sense of humor, and they feel better of what is going on in this wonderful way that people who are *yogin*s are suspending the, uh, common way of looking at it, and choosing some coins instead and, uh, so *lokatāṁ dikam*—just fooling that they're very deep in *samādhi*, but, uh, it's just a show. 

So this is the etymological interpretation of *samādhāna. Sarvam sarveṣu bhūteṣu ātmānam*. The condition is *citranigrahaḥ*, that the mind has to be resolved because as long as the mind is there, it always plays off tricks and, uh, the magic and... 

But the condition for the true *samādhi* is that sense of equality with all beings. Not only human beings, *sarveṣu bhūteṣu*. And if you just take the... close your eyes and you don't have compassion or you don't have a feeling of unity with other beings, then it is cheating. That is befooling. 

So we have several times when the Devī is asking Śiva that she does it out of compassion. So if the whole Yoga is also a contribution to a sense of compassion, then this is referring back to the Devī's intention. 

And the higher the *yogin* goes—sometimes we have this idea that the higher *yogin*s, they are completely detached, not paying any more [attention] to the world but forget themselves—unless they can also, uh, have that sense of equality or sense of harmony with other beings. Otherwise it is not true *samādhi*. 

So [verse 18]:

> sarveṣu bhūteṣu tulyaṁ cittam ātmāni yojayet |
>
> cittaikāgratayā yukto yuktaścittena varttate || 18 ||

Completely fixing the mind equally in all living beings by overcoming the sense of inequality is absorption in a state devoid of the mind. And this is called the real *samādhāna*. And that reflection on the equality with one's own self—that is very good *samādhāna. Sarvatra tulyaḥ*, being equal. So not having any feeling of caste or gender or class or whatever, the sense of harmonies and some equality which is not at the low level, not at the lower level of—as we had the ethical conditions—but precisely the highest level of *samādhi. Sarvatra tulya dr̥ṣṭaṁ cittam*. 

Otherwise, the kind of *samādhāna* which consists just in closing one's eyes, that is the opposite of real *samādhāna*, that is only the [act of] deceiving people. 

And now, uh, the second, what's this *śhuddhavikalpaḥ*? This pure thought. He gives the best example. When one has a sense of—again, a sense of equality for all beings in this world—seeing oneself and others as equal, contemplating thus "I am Śhiva, I am free from duality," this is called the highest state of *samādhi*. 

So the sense of equality will be the same in the *ānava samādhi*, and in the *śhāktopāyaḥ*—[the] sense of equality. But because it is *śhāktā*, there is one thought which is a kind of *mantra*: "Śhivo'haṁ," "advitīyo'haṁ". So that can be used as a *mantra* to get into that state. 

You can... "Śhivo'haṁ" is the *mantra*. "So'haṁ"... all these *śhuddhavikalpaḥ* are not ordinary *mantra*s, but they are, uh, of the... same... we have the same function. "Śhivo'haṁ advitīyo'haṁ samādhisvarūpataḥ." So this is, uh, something which the *yogin* can practice, and both on *ānava* and on *śhāktā* they are good [at] practicing it. In practicing, that sense of equality is also a kind of practice. 

And then you'll see that we come... but "I am Śhiva, I am free from duality." I am non-dual, [but that does] not make [any] sense, so I've translated it as "I am free from duality." Because being free from duality... the question is always how [does] that *advaita*... what kind of influence [does] *advaita* have on our living in the world? Is it only a very high, uh, you know, union with the Divine? Etc. But *advaita* also has [a] practice in relationship to others and this is implied here. "Advitīyo'haṁ" is "I am also not non-dual from you or from others from whoever, whatever these..." And this is a very famous *mantra* and can be also used as a... 

"I am verily all this." All this means the whole of reality. So this is the universal *vikalpa*. Identifying yourself with everything. And then, of course, there's no duality with anything or anybody else, and that has to become an experience. 

"Sarvaṁ eva ahaṁ eva"—"That means Śhiva". Whether you call him Śhiva, or you call him any other name, but "Sarvaṁ eva ahaṁ eva". And this is a meditation which can be done. We don't need to be already at this very highest level, but you can meditate on this. If you go to a... it's easier to meditate on this when you are in a place of nature where there's no, uh, distraction. Later on we have to practice it also in the world, but "I am verily all this", this whole universe—it's so beautiful. 

And this is the unity of "ahaṁ" and "idam," of subject and object. That is the overcoming of the duality of subject and object. "Ahaṁ idam," this is called the highest *samādhi*, which is of the nature of the arising of pure wisdom consisting in a state of the unity of subject and object. This is well-known, according to tradition. 

Now what is here "pure wisdom"? *Śhuddhavikalpaḥ*, but also we have an idea of the 36 *tattva*s in the Śaiva tradition. The *tattva*s which belong to the field of *māyā*, starting from the earth up to *māyā*. They are called "impure elements." And after *māyā* there is a kind of quantum leap to *śuddhavidyā* (pure wisdom). And from *śuddhavidyā* starts the ascent to the divine levels. But this is the transformation of *māyā* into *śuddhavidyā*. But this is also that... that either... and Śaivism is not that *māyā* is not just illusion, it's not just unreality. But it is just like the two sides of the same coin. The same coin: one side is *māyā*, the other side is *śuddhavidyā*. And then immediately you can rise to the divine levels. 

Yes. Then he introduces, uh, verse 19. Now he explains the ever-arisen *samādhi* according to *anūpajā*, which is attained once and for all and is not dependent on any further means. Now he does not follow the sequence, but he goes according to the meaning of the *śloka*. Otherwise, it would be *śāṁbhava* and then *anūpajā*. But here, he identifies this as [a] synonym with *anūpajā*. That is to say, an empty... mhm...

> samyak svarūpa saṁvedyam, samv- rūpaṁ svabhāvajam |
>
> tvaṁ samvid svarūpaṁ ca, samādhiṁ paraṁ viduḥ || 19 ||

This is known as the supreme *samādhāna* in which the perfect essential nature, transformed awareness, the nature of consciousness arising from one's own being, and the true nature of one's own experience are realized. 

It is a constant repetition of this *svarūpa, svabhāva, samvedya*. Again, *svarūpa svabhāva, samvedya*. Again, *svarūpa*. So, he defines this or he puts it in the category of *anūpajā* where nothing is to be done. It is already that experience, and that true nature is already achieved. But it's an extra one here. 

And what distinguishes... of course, many people, we have experiences—very powerful experiences—but the question is whether [or not] they are lasting or [if] they are going up and down. So, an... *anūpajā*... the characteristic of *anūpajā* is that there is no change. That once and for all, a very powerful experience, and then [it] will remain in that state without any coming down. 

This is the difference between the other *vi*– uh– *bhāva*s where you can practice and then maybe sometimes you are very high, then again you start a bit lower, then come again. But *anūpajā* means there is no coming down. It's once and for all. 

So, the commentary says, "By a perfect, once-and-for-all means, the abode of consciousness flashes forth; that which is of the nature—the natural essence of consciousness—one's own nature being expanded. This is the ever-arisen supreme *samādhāna*. The true nature of one's own experience which is self-illumined and from which one does not fall." *Nityodita*. This is the very frequent characteristic of that highest state. Well, of the divine itself. *Nityodita*, which is [the] ever-arisen, ever-continuous state in the high states. *Nityodita*. And then also of the *yogin*, who is *tasya samvedyaṁ svarūpaṁ, svaprakāśam*—it's also self-illumined. So, he has the characteristics of the divine: ever arisen. And *vyutthāna*. 

There are two, uh, opposite states: *samādhi* and *vyutthāna. Samādhi* is absorption, *vyutthāna* is external consciousness [where] the senses are going out and [performing] active activities, etc. So, *avyutthāna* means a *samādhi* which does not again go outside the... the awareness and which does not lose that state of ever-arisen being. 

And now comes the fourth type of *samādhi*, which he introduces:

> avikālpākhyāṁ śāṁbhavasamādhiḥ || 20 ||

Now he explains *śāṁbhavasamādhiḥ*, which is the thought-free means. *Śāṁbhava* is also defined as "thought-free". He compares at [verse] 20:

> pratyag vijñānacetasaḥ |
>
> pratyag vijñānacetasaśca vicāranipuṇaṁ padaṁ yan nityaṁ śāśvataṁ rūpaṁ samādhiṁ tu taṁ viduḥ || 20 ||

This is known as *samādhāna* when one has discerned that through the [act] of... of conscious inner things, one realizes the immutable, eternal, everlasting state. The *śāṁbhava*, the divine, means and implies also that constant awareness of the divine and of the, uh, the divine in all things—that's why also in the *jada*, also in the unconscious, and in the conscious beings. In all, uh, realizing that, uh, state, which is permanent and which is eternal, etc. 

*Nikuṁbhaḥ*. And then *sv- nikuṁbhaḥ* here. Now, the commentary on, uh, this. And they had covered all the four versions of... That mass of inner things [includes] the world, objects, the body, etc. The mass of conscious beings consists in a group of experiences. Now there's a fourth. In Śaivism, they are the seven *padārtha*s. They are different levels of subjects, which correspond to levels of consciousness from the individual (*sakala*), this, up to Śiva—seven levels. So this is a, uh, a group of conscious beings. 

Discerning skillfully in the middle of all these, a state which is the support of the entire universe—this is the *māyā*. In the middle of all this... you may be in any condition, outside, with all kinds of distractions. But in the middle of all this, to discern that which... *viśvātīta sthāna*, that which is the support of the whole universe. Reflecting carefully on that, which is eternal, indestructible, everlasting, devoid of any change and alteration, whose nature is ever self-illumined, and shines forth. That is known by the wise as *samādhiḥ*. 

So it is an awareness. It's also a constant awareness, but in the middle of all conscious or unconscious things, and to be aware of that permanent support of the whole universe. This can be used... but this is a *samādhi*, but it can be used as a meditation. Some of these *samādhi*s can be used just as a meditation. Like *śivo'haṁ*, that you know. You can use it if you are not yet in that state, but you can practice with that. 

Yes. I think we conclude here. Just with that last concluding sentence, "By the effort of *yogin* he has demonstrated this, and by summarizing, he shows the natural connection." This concept that you want, that he can do it tomorrow. 

So as I said, there are two aspects of *samādhi* which are quite unique here. One is the sense of equality and harmony with all beings in both directions. *Samā*– and playing with the etymology of *samā*– *sama* (harmony) and *samādhi*. And the other is that even within *samādhi* there can be these four states. But everybody is *samādhi*. When you achieve [it] once, you can be already happy. But if you are more, uh, progressed then you can experience all. So, it comes through here, this is a good point. And I explain all you... some answers to some questions.
