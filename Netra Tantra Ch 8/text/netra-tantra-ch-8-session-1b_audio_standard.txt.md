## Deconstructing Aṣṭāṅgayoga: A Tantric Perspective

The following analysis explores a complex passage concerning the concept of Aṣṭāṅgayoga within a specific Tantric framework, contrasting it with the more familiar Patañjali Yoga Sūtra. The passage delves into a nuanced understanding of language, highlighting the limitations of words while simultaneously acknowledging their transcendental source, *paśyantī*. This analysis will unpack the text, providing punctuation, paragraph breaks, and grammatical corrections while preserving the original content. Sanskrit terms will be transliterated using the IAST alphabet.

...etc. is spoken. Now, once I mentioned at the very beginning that the four levels of the world are represented ultimately, that language is not limited—of course not limited—to the spoken or written and not even limited to the mind or the thought, but it comes [from] *paśyantī*, not the thought power, which is absolutely the transcendental source. But it says there [are] no words which cannot be expressed by any word. [This] means not even by *paśyantī*. But this is not just by human language, which is not an object of the senses, whether external or internal. That which expresses is called *vāca* (*vāṇī*), and that which is expressed is also called *vāca* (*vāṇī*). Now, *varṇa*, of course, has several meanings. *Varṇa* and *rasa* both have several meanings. So, he takes it in the sense of *vāṇī*. Meaning that the essence which flows forth is free from the expression, expressor, and the expressed. So, Abhinavagupta takes *varṇa* in the sense of *vāṇī*. And yet, the nature of the absolute mover, who is beyond measure, is united with all of these *varṇas* and *rasas* because of his universal nature, which Abhinavagupta adds. 

Now, you remember also in the sixth chapter when, um, the tantra very briefly indicates the three ways of *dhyāna*, and it describes the *parā dhyāna* as *sarvātmakam*, that which is universal. Because it's only at the supreme divine level that this universality is attained, also that *yogī*. Everything at the lower level is still limited to certain forms, experiences, practices, etc. But this *viśvātmakam*, it is, um, universal. Attaining that very state means that he is merged in it. He is absorbed in it. Attaining that divine nature means being absorbed in *samāveśa*, *samāveśatvam*. 

And then he quotes, um, the verse from the *Mālinīvijayottara Tantra* with a very brief definition: "What is yoga? Yoga—*yoga ekatvam icchati*." Yoga is unity—unity of one thing with another. Here, not even defined in the spiritual sense, but in the very common sense, *yoga* means joining or uniting one thing with another. That is *yoga*. From the most practical level to the highest level, it means the union or unification of one thing with another. *Yoga ekatvam icchati.* This being the case, the *yogīs* who are united with the supreme reality are free from all their dependence. And then he quotes the Bhagavad-Gītā: "Those who are absorbed in me, they are ever united with me." 

So that *yoga*, of course, also implies *bhakti* because the union or the union with the divine as the beloved as the... So, that unity or that woman is also implied already in *yoga*. Of course, *bhakti*, *bhakti* is for those...

Now, the, um, the difference to the *Yoga Sūtra* of Patañjali or the Hatha Yoga—here, they both are qualified [by]—that *abhyāsenamahā vairāgya vairāgya vairāgya paraiṇā*—both are describing higher levels. By, uh, great renunciation, by supreme...not by great practice and by supreme renunciation. So, what this qualification means [is] that by supreme renunciation—meaning the effort of being ever absorbed... So, renunciation does not mean giving up something in a negative way, but being so totally absorbed that the things fall off. That is by great... that this is the...the real, uh, meaning of renunciation is not some artificial, uh, giving up of certain things which I actually would like to have. But, the being absorbed [in] something so much greater that all those likes and dislikes fall off. And, uh, so, *vairāgya* is also, if it is an effort, it is the effort to be ever merged in that supreme reality, to be ever absorbed in that reality. And, uh, it also means dispassion towards all objects of enjoyment, which are seen and which are produced from the earth up to...*anasrita shiva*. Therefore, they attained oneness due to the extinction of all thoughts like attachment, hatred, etc. He [had] no ego and pride due to the worship of Shiva. He is equal to me. And by the destruction of ignorance, which is the darkness of the form of conceiving the non-self as the self, he attains the eternal, unchanging, ever-new, transcendental Shiva, who is imperishable, supreme, good, who is, therefore, the absolute beyond the three. 

But this is the... And now comes what actually this *parā dhyāna*, what it consists in. It's not the statement of the unity, [the] already existing unity, that is not sufficient. But what is actually the practice or the...the state of the *yogī* [at] that level? And this comes here in a very mysterious verse, eight...the half of eight and half of nine. Only this one verse: 8B and 9A. *nimeṣonmeṣamātreṇa yadīcchaivaopalabhyate tataḥ prakṛtimuktasyo na punarjanmajāpnuyāt aṣṭau*...

Literally, *unmeṣa nimeṣa* means the opening and closing of the eyes, or opening in a wider sense—expansion and contraction, etc. So, this first verse of the *Spanda Kārikā* means by the opening and closing of the eyes, the world is created and dissolved. Yes, it starts as *nimeṣonmeṣābhyām jagataḥ pralayodayau*, and that *pralayodayau*, the world is dissolved and is again created. Just by the opening and closing of his eyes. But, of course, this is a symbolic expression. That is nothing to do with the third eye here—eyes in general. But it is symbolic for the whole... the other concept. There are concepts—*saṁkucita kāśa*: that which expands and that which contracts. So, the actual *spanda*, the vibration, is always a vibration between expansion and contraction, or opening and closing. There is... etc. 

Now, here there is just half a verse, *nimeṣonmeṣamātreṇa*, or even one quarter. "By the mere opening and closing of the eyes, if he is attained..." I don't know what it is in your translation because I have... I've been unchanging that, uh, translation. "If he realizes by the mere opening and closing of the eye, then, due to this realization itself, he is liberated. He will not be born again." Wow, such a powerful statement! But just one phrase which we don't know exactly what it means. So, I've been struggling with this meaning because here commentary is not helpful, or only partially helpful. He says, "By any means, generally, which it is to be inferred in the center," not here. Now, this is the center between, uh, opening and closing, or... So, which center is meant here? But then, I came to another, uh...

What is in the translation which was distributed? It... Because it made a difference from what I... Yeah, uh, it... "If he realizes by the mere opening and closing of the eye." Yeah, "then due to itself he is liberated." Yeah, Yes. But then, I got another idea which came also from some, uh, other text. *Nimeṣa* also means "a moment." It's a very tiny unit of time. So then, I understood it, uh, as, um, by merely—by an awakening—*unmeṣa* also means "awakening," also "spiritual awakening." By an awakening in a moment, so spontaneous or sudden awakening. So, now I'm rather sticking to this interpretation unless I find some other source to, uh, confirm it or to change it. By the mere...*mātra* means "only," but by a mere awakening in a moment—that would of course, it confirms the...the whole spirituality of sudden enlightenment. And, uh... And at the *parā* level, of course, it can be just sudden enlightenment. *Nimeṣa unmeṣamātreṇa*. Because he doesn't say anything more. 

Now, this *madhya*, "in the center," uh, we have studied the *Vijnānabhairava*. Know that there are many experiences which happen in the center between two perceptions, or two experiences, or two things, or two, uh... So, the center which is, uh, neither this nor that, and which is, therefore, a pure consciousness which is underlying this and that. And we have many, uh, such practices in the *Vijnāna Bhairava* starting from the center between *prāṇa* and *apāna*. So, this is possible that he had in mind here the center as that center between any two poles which makes you enter into pure consciousness. So, anyhow... But this is so important because he starts the whole practice of the... of the *Paratantra* with this phrase. So, they have to try to make some sense out of it when he says that, uh, he explains he attains to *parāparatva*. And "attaining" also is always something else—it's always "I attain something which is not myself." And *upalabdhi* means always "it is"...he, uh, gets absorbed—"attaining" means getting absorbed. Then, it is, uh...yeah. Then depending on that... that... *na tathkalāntare*, not on any other moment of time, so that would confirm my interpretation that in a moment, the awakening in a moment, not in other later time. He is liberated means that he's endowed with divine qualities, even in his body—that *bhāvanā*. Now, this is the ideal of *jīvanmukti*. *Jīvanmukti* in this whole thing, this one verse, the short commentary on it, uh, maybe indicating *jīvanmukti*, which can be attained in a moment of awakening. And not to wait for... Yes, now I have... I have reached a certain point, but I am still waiting for the *jīvanmukti*. I am still waiting for it. So, not to wait for any other moment, it is in that very moment. *Na tathkalāntare*. He does not obtain another body in the worlds after leaving this body, but he verily becomes the Supreme Śiva. Yeah, so this one verse is so important we give them, uh, we have to give some time for it. 

And now comes the topic which all of those who have studied Patañjali and a lot of, uh, Patañjali yoga will be surprised [by], because it comes now: **Aṣṭāṅgayoga**. So, we can recite it. We can recite it together from my... Of their... So, paragraph nine to eleven, the whole verse of nine... Yeah. The whole verse is nine. Yeah. So... *tataḥ prakṛtimuktasya na punarjanma jāpnuyāt aṣṭāṅgenāyugena prāṇuyāmnādanyathā vatsa saṃsāradhīratvāt nityam yathā parāvare 'taḥ ālānatupāre tata eva nityamniyamo jāyate madhyamaṃ prāṇamāśritya prāṇāpānagatāntaramālāmbya jñānaśaktiṃ ca tat saṃjāyate na ke*... The whole *Aṣṭāṅgayoga* of Patañjali, because the names are the same, but it gets a complete different interpretation. So, we have to go very slow here because this is essential for understanding the entire yoga of the *Tantrāloka*. Yeah. 

So, here he says, "He attains by means of the eightfold yoga"—*aṣṭāṅgena*—but what kind of eight [it] *aṅgas* are these? They are quite different. And not otherwise... *sākṣāllābha*. And he knows it; he teaches this eight...eight limb yoga in order... in contrast to that which has been taught in other *śāstras*, of course mainly Patañjali, but... But [we] also are interested... we have those lists, you know, of the *ṣaḍaṅgayoga* and *aṣṭāṅgayoga* in the different Śaiva, uh, Tantras, etcetera. It...these lists are in the book by Somadeva Vasudeva. And, uh, we can also...you can have a photocopy if you are specifically interested [in] a comparative table of the... what kind of *aṅgas*... Yes, of course, there are also appendices in Swami G's Volume Two of the *Yoga Sūtras* that lists every definition of *aṅgas*—of... of the individual, uh, *yamas* and *niyamas*—in all texts across all traditions, including Jain and Buddhist. So, it's a real good comparative tool. Yeah. 

The question is whether we want to... Now we are familiar with the Patañjali, so it will not take, uh, much time to compare, and that is quite clear. But if we have Patañjali here [it] would be also useful, uh, just to see the...the different definition. Maybe I didn't bring any other, uh, the... also the Somadeva Vasudeva's book because he also mentions about these comparisons. Maybe in the afternoon. 

Now, when I spoke about the six *aṅgas*—*ṣaṭaṅga*—which is the normal list of Śaiva yoga, they don't contain *yama* and *niyama*. But here, every one of the Patañjali numbers is given a different interpretation. So, what is... What is *yama*? *Yama* is ever being detached from the world, from *saṃsāra*. *Yama* means, yeah, to be ever detached from the world of becoming. So just in one line he finishes with *yama*. There's no list of different *yamas* and *niyamas*, etcetera. And the implication is, of course, that if that detachment is there, then these, uh, *yamas* will be automatically [the] consequence. But he doesn't say it directly, but that we have to infer. 

And what is *niyama*? *Niyama* is *bhāvanā* to *paratattva*. Yesterday, we [spoke] about *bhāvanā*; [it] is a constant contemplation on the Supreme Reality. See, both kinds of disciplines, they are lifted to a level where there is no need to detail, you know, *ahiṃsā*, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, because it is already placed at the level of the *paratattva*—Supreme Reality. Constant contemplation of the Supreme Reality, that is *niyama*. 

Now, *āsana* is very surprising. Because *āsana* actually... Śaiva yoga, uh, starts with *prāṇa*. *Prāṇa* is not the *hathayogic prāṇāyāma*, etcetera. And this verse eleven is very important: *madhyamaṃ prāṇamāśritya prāṇāpānagatāntaramālāmbya jñānaśaktiṃ ca tat saṃjāyate na ke*. "Resting in the central *prāṇa* at the junction between the parts of exhalation and inhalation, supported by the energy of awareness"—here, *jñānaśakti* comes here, this energy of awareness—"and establishing himself in that, he should take hold of his seat." So, *āsana* is here nothing physical—no physical, uh, posture. But it is a starting point. Because it's a support—[the] starting point is on his already being in that central part on which we have spoken before, between *prāṇa* and *apāna*, uh, in that *uḍāna*. That...*ālambya jñānaśaktiṃ ca*, supporting himself on that power of awareness. So here, he puts practically *āsana* at the level of *śaktipāta*. It is a practice of awareness, pure awareness—*ālambya*. You... we can, uh, take the commentary. Supporting himself on the *uḍāna*, the rising breath, which is, uh, the rising *prāṇa* situated in the central *nāḍī* between exhalation and inhalation—in between the left and the right channel. And then by merging his pervading *prāṇa* and making emerge the pervading consciousness, he unfolds the energy of awareness of the nature of flashing forth and supports himself on this consciousness. 

Now, [these] two terms I have spoken again and again on—*vyāpti*, although this is definitely not sufficiently clear, this pervading *śakti*, *vyāpti*, the pervading of consciousness, *jñānaśakti*, only should support that *uḍāna*. And then, [the] *yogī* attains that... the nature... *jñānaśakti āsana*...*āsanacinmaheśvaraḥ*...*chinmaheśvarūpaḥ bhavet*. This is very powerful. The *yogī* who is established on this kind of *āsana*, he becomes of the nature of the great Lord of Consciousness—*chinmaheśa*.
