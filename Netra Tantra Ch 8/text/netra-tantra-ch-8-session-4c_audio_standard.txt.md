I can, I can go to the disco. And I can… okay, you can go, but only after you have reached that state. 

However dense condition and whichever observance one follows, by whichever path of yoga, the yogi gains perfection through different and most natural states (sixty-eighteen). However, between Navaratri is a time in itself where that… difficult conceptual translation… but it’s not bad as… However, this condition… and this is not so consoling because they are not always in the highest contemplative mood. But once we have made that experience, and then we know in any condition—there may be sitting in the train and the main train maybe or the train—or all kinds of uh tests for your patience and all kinds of situations, but any situation that perfection can be attained. That which is the supreme reality called Lord manifestation. 

Now verse sixty-three, sixty: 

> ekaṃ bahudhā dēvyāḥ 

Oh, Goddess! That one supreme reality meditated upon in manifold ways bestows perfection, whether in the non-dual or dual or mixed traditions, whether in the tradition of the solitary hero (ēkavīraḥ) or that of *yamala*, by means of all the *śāstras* it always bestows perfection. 

Here again, what he said before: in all the *śāstras* this is revealed, in all the scriptures he already teach them, and here he gives uh the names of some Tantric uh schools like *ēkavīraḥ, yamala,* etc., which are different Tantric traditions, and it is open—whether in the non-dual or dual or mixed traditions—and uh and names of all the *śāstras*, he always bestows perfection, so that all seated on that… that *ekaṃ,* that one means a supreme non-duality. 

Now from verse fifty-eight till the end, sixty-four, uh it is actually um… he comes back to the king of the *Mantra-rāja*, the king of *mantras*, which is the *Netra-mantra,* and uh that this *mantra* can be recited also under any condition without any pre-condition, etc., etc. That we don’t need to read this, you can easily read it, just description, and uh *Paratantra* is actually concluded even before that as he says that by repetition, he just gives a summary of the whole teaching and uh Shiva has already put the stamp on it, that this is true, this is the truth. 

So, we can uh conclude our *Paratantra* here, and with the *Paratantra*, of course, the whole yoga, all the yoga chapters six and seven, which uh I think quite unique in many ways, quite unique. And uh we bring it into consonance with our tradition, although this is a task. And then chapter seven and nine is just also an inspiration to… to continue with this. It’s not possible in a few days to get deeply into such a… which… spirituality. But it gives hopefully the inspiration to continue and to go deeper into their practice, and again also the text itself, it is Shiva. They conclude with the *śivōdaḥ śivōdaḥ śivōdaḥ.* 

That number three. Yes, it… *śivōdaḥ śivōdaḥ śivōdaḥ* *śivaḥ sarvaṃ idaṃ jagat tasmāt śabdārthacin tāsu naśāvāsānāyā śivaḥ.* 

One, two, *śivōdaḥ śivōdaḥ śivaḥ sarvaṃ idaṃ jagat tasmāt śabdārthacin tāsu naśāvāsānāyā śivaḥ.*

One, two, *śivōdaḥ śivōdaḥ śivaḥ sarvaṃ idaṃ jagat tasmāt śabdārthacin tāsu naśāvāsānāyā śivaḥ*.
