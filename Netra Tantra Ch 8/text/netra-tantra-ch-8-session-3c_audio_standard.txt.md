When home, as you know, the system is energy, is *Śakti*, has expanded. And this is a very significant commentary on this. The yogi was a day (that state), having turned his senses inward, and the moment of the first awakening (consisting in reducing the breath by one duty), he knows everything, past and future. And that reality is of the nature of the energy, consisting in illuminating inside. 

This is very important. In Trivandrum, *yogi kriyā*, I've said that before also that the sense organs or sense perception are not... sense organs are not to be suppressed, but they have to be internalized under *yogi kriyā*. And then there is a method, *tuṭibhavat*, meaning *ādya unmeṣat unmeṣat ādya unmeṣat*. *Unmeṣat*... he had this in the beginning of the *Āratiyana*, and I will expand it in the book. We have no time here to go in such details. But *unmeṣat* is very important for... also for awakening, ultimate awakening. And there is an awakening which takes place when the senses are completely interiorized. And in the some initial moment... the initial moment of any perception or any experience or any knowledge - that is a kind of awakening. 

And there is a practice in the system which is called *prathama tuṭīya prathama prakāśa*, and uh... this can be practiced anytime, anywhere, in any condition. That to direct your awareness to the first moment of an arising of thought or a feeling or a perception. *Prathama prakāśa*. That means the first arising. And mostly when we live without awareness, we let just go out and we completely uh... forget that moment when something has sprung up. Some experience, some uh... sensation, etc. And that is what *prathama tuṭi tuṭibhya* means, the first moment of *prathama prakāśa*, that first manifestation of consciousness, in just a second of awareness, before you let it go out and into distraction or into any activity or talk, etc. So that they refer to here.

But this... this presupposes your asking how to sharpen the subtle uh... awareness. This is that method. But the first condition for that is already to have internalized your senses. If you have not controlled the senses are always controlling, is something uh... evident. But it's not controlling the senses. Internalizing is something beautiful, but it's not beautiful. It is rather... becomes more beautiful when you... and the more you are interiorized, the more you can also enjoy the beautiful. If we see whether it's music or a painting or nature, or... it's on the condition that you have already internalized the senses. And then to pay that subtle uh... awareness directly subtle awareness to the moment of arising a sensation or a feeling or a sense perception. And he relates this with the expansion of the energy. 

So that I is, he says *puruṣa*. The first I have translated *puruṣa*, that's quite okay. That's not the... And then he says that uh, he knows everything, past and future. And that reality is of the nature of the energy consisting in illuminating inside. *Pratibhā*. Now *pratibhā* is also enlightenment. Then illuminated inside at this both uh... creative... Any creativity in the art, in the act of creation, it requires *pratibhā*. It requires some inspiration, some insight, some... some flash of uh, flash of inspiration. *Pratibhā*. And that *pratibhā*, the reality of that *pratibhā* is characteristic of *Śakti*. *Śakti lakṣaṇa*. So when do we know that *Śakti* has visited us? When we get some flash of insight. Not when we are very tired and the just directing now routine uh... thought, routine work, routine uh... style of life. No, then it's a *Śakti* gives us a flash of inspiration. But let's notice this. *Pratibhā* that that *Śakti lakṣaṇa*. 

Then 33 to 34. "Wherever will or knowledge arise and they take the form of accomplished activity, that reality is of the nature of energy." So he goes on describing what exactly... how she manifests. How do you know that it is... it is the energy? It is she who arises as *cit*, as *jñāna*. And then she's transformed into creation, to activity. And this what we have already said, may be a repeat, many things, but anyway...

The same qualities which are of the divine are also ours. The same... But our will... we will not know anything without knowledge, without act. So from the purely psychological uh uh... level, which is, of course, *saṃkocita*. Which is, of course, limited. Our will is limited, our knowledge is... our activity is limited. But it is all a participation in that divine energy, whose nature is *cit jñāna kriyā*. So our expansion of our consciousness is precisely to move from that *saṃkocita*, from that limited uh... awareness of our will, knowledge, activity to making it more and more unified with the divine power, the divine energy which is acting in us. So that is why he... he comes here to the description of the *Śakti*, because he said if that... if the yogi is not pervaded by that energy, then the self is not pure. And that energy can be experienced in *pratibhā*. In uh... in that uh... *cit jñāna kriyā* which is all in us. But we always bathe in our limited experience. See, we are not capable, we are not able, we are not uh... we are not expert at, and all that. That is a lack of *Śakti*. Absence of *Śakti*. 

And uh... and *cinmaya ca*... "Where the will of the one whose essential nature is spontaneous and thought-free is not if accomplished or arisen, where the act of knowledge is of the nature of flesh and thought, and where activity occurs. In that location, there itself is experienced that reality which is of the nature of pure, unpolluted will. Of the nature of energy." So that is *śuddhi ca cit bhavat*, meaning that from *Śakti lakṣaṇa*. You can... every uh... every verse we are describing the energy, it ends in this reality is of the nature of *Śakti*. That... that... that's *Śakti lakṣaṇa*. That that... So to recognize... Recognition is, after all, the central uh... target of philosophy. And not only recognize yourself, but recognize the energy, that *Śakti*. You can recognize that in these and these ways. 

34 CD. "Oh Goddess, within the yogi whose self has become all-pervasive, being of the nature of pure consciousness, the wonderful, blissful energy flows forth from Śiva. This energy is known as the supreme." *Cit prakāśya vyāprakāśya*. So this is related to the yogi, whose nature is the nature of consciousness which is pervasive or all-pervasive. At that *ānanda*, that wonderful, blissful energy. At that *ānanda*, *ātmananda*. At *putra*, we have this *viṣmaya camatkāra*, that which is... gives a surprise, wonder. Of the nature of wonderful, blissful wonder. *Prasarati*, at that *ānanda*. This *Śakti*, she flows. This *Śakti* is, of course, of the nature of the blissful wonder. She flows forth, and she's known as the supreme. That... And *cinmaya ca*. When the self of the yogi experiences the pervasiveness of pure consciousness, then the energy, full of wonder and bliss, comes forth. That is, unfolds from Śiva. *Āścarya*, at uh... that different words. *Āścarya*, wonderful, surprising. *Ānandamaya Śakti, Śiva prasarati unmeṣatibhi*, again *unmeṣatim*, self unfolds. So up to this verse, up to this point, the expansion of the energy described is established. The expansion of the energy. So how long did we recite? 37. Okay, 80%.

"Having expanded his..." 35 CD. "Having expanded his own self, the yogi is endowed with the qualities of omniscience and delight. Oh Goddess, he discerns in this shining manifestation of supreme force." *Ā prakāśa*, manifestation, shining manifestation, uh... translating uh... *prakāśa* is uh... The root... the root power is so frequent in this or tradition part of shine... And our pastor is that the shines forth, that is manifestation. 

So there are two forms of Śiva: *saṃpāśa* and *nirupāśa*. Śiva in his manifestation and Śiva beyond this... beyond manifestation. Śiva as if having expanded himself by if... through reflection through the qualities of omniscience, etc. Then quotes from *Yogasūtra* 3:42. This is the translation, I don't know whether it's my own translation or somebody... "The non-ideational state projected outside is the great bodiless one. And this removes the covering over the light of consciousness." I think I've given this translation before. So you can see on the text which are quoted is authoritative. Of course, there are other tantras, but *Yogasūtra* is quoted at a very important uh... context. 

*Videha*, yes. *Videha, Mahāvideha*, great bodiless one. Non-ideation state, *akalpita vṛtti, akalpita vṛtti*. It removes the covering over the light of consciousness, *ākāśa āvaraṇa kṣaya*. It's very important *sūtra*, of course. And as we look at the commentary uh... of the Vyāsa *bhāṣya*, he has just quoted in the context of *saṃpāśa* Śiva. 

The yogi was expanded according to the state mentioned above is endowed with all qualities, like omniscience, etc., and due to his creative self-awareness of omniscience, he is called manifest Śiva, *saṃpāśa* Śiva. 

Then 36 CD. "He who is thus endowed with infinite energies is omniscient and fully satisfied. His awakening is beginningless, he is totally free, and he cannot lose any of these accomplishments." This is very consoling, I underlined that. He cannot lose. And thus I said uh... earlier that in the tantric uh... language, this idea of being fully satisfied, *triptī*, it is so important because it implies that all this... everything is filled with that bliss. *Triptī*, this... it is not just that, "Oh, Śiva must be very satisfied", and no, he's full with uh... satisfaction, like after a pizza or something. Uh, that is uh... all around... all around satisfied. And this also very beautiful. His enlightenment, his awakening is without beginning. *Anādi anādi*. So you will find when we think that enlightening has that... is a moment... Yes, at some point of time the Buddha was enlightened, such and such a day, such and such a place, etc. But that is no meaning. Enlightenment has no beginning. It's not... And we are so much bound in this time-space frame, you know, that, "Yes, I had an experience", and that place and at that time. But what does it mean? This space-time? That enlightenment has no beginning. Once you have it, there's no question of space and time. *Anādi anādi*. And if it is realized as beginningless, then it cannot be lost. Because you can only lose something which you have got in time. You got something at a certain moment or a certain place, so that either you forget it or you can lose it. But you cannot lose that which is beginningless. It's very powerful. 

He's totally free, in all tenses. The possessor of power, Śiva, maintains his qualities by differentiating the *guṇas*, and therefore he becomes full of good qualities, *saṃkalpa guṇaiḥ guṇaiḥ*. He reflects upon the multiplicity of differentiation, and this called his manifestation. Not the *saṃpāśa*, but this Śiva of the yogi. He... he contains the multiplicity also. *Nirupāśa*, he does not exclude it, he includes it. But now I will tell you about the one who is beyond manifestation, *Virupāśa*, of beyond manifestation. 

In many of these texts you will find sometimes some uh... double ambiguity: is he speaking of Śiva or is he speaking of the yogi? Sometimes it's not very clear that in a context he's speaking of the yogi, but the same time you can see he's speaking of Śiva. Because first he describes Śiva in his manifestation, *Saṃpāśa*, and then without manifestation, *Nirupāśa*, but at the same time he speaks of the yogi. So it is a that uh... double... two levels of the meaning. Where... and the enlightened one doesn't distinguish. We will just uh... Oh no, this is a longer commentary, so I think we'll leave it for the afternoon because now something very, very, very crucial is coming, and it's better to keep it for then, we are again fresh.

So we... we'll conclude the session by reciting the *netra mantra*, because we have neglected it a bit, and we should practice it, and tomorrow, *Śiva sūtra* also be included. So we recited uh... again eleven times...
