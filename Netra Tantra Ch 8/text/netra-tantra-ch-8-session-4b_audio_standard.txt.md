## Abandoning Everything Else

Now, this is the clue for the whole negation: abandoning everything else. Established in _samādhi_, one should only abide as one with *that*. This _samādhi_… that… that _samādhi_. That… on that. And that… that is the finish. That, it means _bhavanā_. That only. And this name… it doesn't even say Śiva. One should… this is so beautiful in itself.

> sarvatattva samādhiṣṭhā kevalaṁ tanmayo bhavet

_Tanmaya_ means that _bhava_, it, one, that, that Supreme, that thing. So, this is something– _bhava_– where all the positive practices, which are here negated, they will be shut– _bhava_. Now, you meditate on a particular… you… uh… focus your _bhavanā_ on something inside or outside the body, etcetera, etcetera.

And now Śivānanda gives– and this is very uh significant– Śivānanda gives examples from the beginning of the chapter. But the examples are not for the negation, but for the positive. 

He says: "Don't meditate inside the body, outside the body." Then he gives examples of meditations inside the body and outside the body, so that you know what is being negated. What is being negated. And this is so beautiful.

I suppose that everyone has the beginning of the chapter in one form or another elsewhere. But still, I will just give a few examples, uh… because giving all will take too much time.

He starts by, when he says, one should not meditate on something above. So, what means "above?" One should… "above" means in the head center. And here, probably "head center" is just the *sahasrāra*. "Below" means in the *mūlādhāra*. "In the middle" means in the heart. And "front," "in the back," or "the sides" means in the form of the aspects of Śiva as Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, etcetera. You have seen, maybe, Śivalinga with four faces? These are the four aspects of uh Śiva through which he has revealed the universe to us.

Within the body, then he gives the example of– again in Chapter 28, which is on the rising form from the _liṅga_. But there also, the word "from the _liṅga_" does not come at all in the whole beginning of the chapter.

> Meditate on the _śakti_ rising from *mūlādhāra*, which is luminous like rays of the sun, and which gets subtler and subtler until it dissolves in *brahmarandhra*; then the state of *parābhavet* is perceptible.

So, each one of those _bhavanas_… there are _bhavanas_. You can also call them _bhavanas_. The actual practice is _bhavanā_. There is something given as a practice, which leads to a result. So that connection of cause and effect, he has just excluded. See, the enlightenment is not an effect of a cause. It is without any cause which you can define.

And then, so the other examples, uh… are just… select… one should not meditate on something below. And that example is so beautiful in the beginning of the chapter.

> By standing above a deep well or any abyss, and fixing one's eyes at the bottom of the well or abyss, one becomes completely free from thoughts, and immediately the mind is certainly dissolved.

So, this is the positive side of meditating on something below. Then, "unless"– it's neither closing one's eyes, nor opening one's eyes, nor in between. The example he gives is, again, in Chapter 88.

> In the same way, by first closing one's eyes and meditating on the darkness in front, and then opening the eyes and contemplating the dark form of bhairava, one becomes one with that.

So, closing and opening are two phases of the same practice. Then, "without fixing one's gaze"– Chapter 61.

> One should cast one's gaze on an open stretch of land devoid of trees, mountains, water, etcetera. And this is when the state of the mind is fixed there, then the fluctuating thoughts dissolve.

So, this is focusing.

And then, as a last example, again in the beginning of 28, when he says "with support and without any support."

> At once will and knowledge have arisen, one should fix one's mind on the point where they merge. With undivided awareness of the self, then one gains insight into the essence of reality. 

So, actually it comes close to the negation, but still, it's not a negation. It is a fixing of the thought on some point. 

Then he concludes… Śivānanda concludes in this way:

> That yogi, having abandoned everything according to the prescription expressed in the section on the respective _bhavanas_, meditates neither on the senses nor on the elements. Being established in _samādhi_ without any trace of thought, he is one with *that*. Devoted only to the reflection on his essential nature… that's the chapter. Thus being merged in a state of bliss, he becomes full of the knowledge of unity. This is *saṁvedanānandaparābhavanā samarasajñāna jñānamayam*.

So, this is the *nirābhāsā*, which has no support and then a particular practice or particular focus. Now, have we recited the 25 or no? 25, 46, 47, 48… up to 49.

> sarvasārvamayaṁ śukraṁ parasya paramātmanaḥ |
> nirābhāsaṁ padam tat tu tat prāpya vimuchyate ||
>
> bhāvayed devam ātmānaṁ ātamanau bhāvanā balāt |
> sakṛcchetta paraṁ śāntaṁ śivam atyanta nirmalam ||
>

> paraṁ tṛtīyam padam uttamam ākhyātaṁ tava deveśi ||

> jñātvā prāptaṁ vimuchyate sarvakālaṁ tu kālasya ||
>
> vañcanaṁ gatitam priye evaṁ tu trividhaṁ devi |
> māyā te prakṛti kṛtam ||

And we keep in mind that last phrase in verse 44:

> sarvatattva samādhiṣṭhā kevalaṁ tanmayo bhavet

…to be established as one with *that*. 

**(Verse 45)** This is called the Supreme state of the highest Self; verily, attaining the state of non-manifestation, one turns away from *saṁsāra*. In this way, one should meditate on the Self through a powerful devotional contemplation of bhairava. Such a yogi becomes the Supreme peaceful Śiva of utmost purity.

Now, this is just an attempt to find another translation for _bhavanā_. The word is also often "_bhavayet_": "One should contemplate." _Bhavet_… By _bhavanā balāt_… See, _bhavanā_ is– when we spoke about _bhavanā_– I also said it's connected with *śakti* and the *śakti* power. So, _bhavanā_ can be very powerful by the power of creative contemplation of what we have to see here. _Bhavanā_ also implies uh… devotional attitude. So, before he has denied all meditations, but here he only says "on the Self," and he attains, or he becomes the Supreme peaceful Śiva of utmost purity. And if you remember, there was the question that "God, if he is not completely pure, because he has not received the *śakti*…" So, this now here is attaining the complete purity because he will see that uh… liberation from all limited by the identification.

Now, Śivānanda says that the _bhavanā_ that contempla– creative contemplation, or contemplative feeling of the thought-free Self, is accomplished by dissolving thoughts, contemplating on that power with a firm reflection: *vikalpa-hānena sampādanam*. See, it is a kind of uh… duplication because you attain the thought-free state by dissolving the thoughts. Now, after dissolving the thoughts, there will come by *vikalpa-hāna*. But this precisely presupposes the power– *bala*. Power of which has the capacity to dissolve thoughts. And "power" means– that is one word which uh… one has to use always in the context of Kashmir Shaivism. "Power" means intensity. _Bhavana balāt_ means one could also say "the intensity of contemplation." See, without intensity, there are many things you can practice, all many things– you know, wonderful things– but without intensity, you cannot reach that state of liberation. 

Now, the uh… French scholar Alexis Sanderson, he has uh… that expression for… the practice of Kaśmīra Śaivism: the prescription of intensity. The most important prescription is of practice. But then something happens. With further reflection, (the) might start arguing, but it's also intense. And that reality… that is the one reality everywhere. That that *ekāmśa*, that one is in a completely universal state. That that everywhere is that one reality because he attains the unity of that oneness. Mṛtyuñjaya Śiva, that is the supreme Ambā, the third highest state. Third, because they are now in the *parādhāna*, which is the third school, esoteric school. "O Goddess, I have revealed this to you, what else can I tell you?" That always– he says that the whole revelation has some completeness in there. And he says that "I have already revealed this secret to you, and now, what else would you like to know?" Now, what else can I tell you? It says, "Nothing beyond. Nothing higher than that." And when he says "this is the one reality everywhere," then Śrī Nārāyaṇa explains, "He becomes mṛtyuñjit, everywhere, starting from the earth up to *anaśvat śikhara*. That is all that." That one non-dual, ultimate reality, the true nature, Śiva, who is the embodiment of the good. Good nature is Śiva– *śivam* as an adjective. The third means beyond the two kinds of knowledge: *śruti* and *smṛti*. You– means of the one supreme grace. You, Śiva, means *anugṛhī eka parāya*, *anugṛha*. "The one who is entirely uh… given to bestow grace." "What else can I tell you?" means beyond this, there is no other secret to be told. Now he summarizes 48 CD. Meditating in this way on everything as Śrī Mṛtyuñjit, the yogī becomes pervasive and indestructible. He obtains liberation. And this, O dear one, I have revealed. The vanquishing of time, death, for all times. Even to *niśākara*, all, and to Kāla, Yama, *tathā anye*. By an instruction into a state of absorption in the light field, the abode of consciousness, which is undivided by time. *Akāla kalita cit dhāma samāveśa upadeśaḥ*. This is (a) real summary of the entire teaching. By the teaching– by an instruction, *upadeśa*, into the absorption, *samāveśaḥ*, in the luminous abode of consciousness, *cit dhāma*, which is *akāla kalita*, which is not fragmented by time. This is a very concise summary of the entire, this last part of the teaching. And the, Śrī Nārāyaṇa says that is– now he naturally sums up what he has expounded before the general summary began, 49 CD to 850. And this way, "O Goddess, I have revealed to you the threefold yoga by which one vanquishes death, which is most difficult to attain." But its practice, and through yoga, a human being becomes liberated. And then, again, we come back to the theme of compassion. Not only for oneself, but also for others. 51… And Śrī Nārāyaṇa says that is… 50, that. No, no, no. That's it. 50 what? No, no, no. Sorry, sorry. 50 to 50…

50… That's 51… By this very yoga, having become liberated, the yogī who desires to bestow grace on the world can grace all living beings. That's so beautiful because the original intention of the Devi to uh… be compassionate towards all the sufferings of living beings. That is replied here at the highest level. And this is maybe one of the differences of this approach to other schools of Vedānta, yoga, etcetera, where you have to start with *ātman*, *satya*, etcetera. But uh… here, it actually comes with the highest spiritual attainment. Only when you have reached that, then you can really be compassionate. Because the problem of being compassionate when you are still identified with your own body, mind, etcetera, is that you will be drawn into that suffering. I tell now the psychologist– not so liberal. But it's quite evident. You are the higher, and you have crossed that. Then you can be really graceful and compassionate. So, this is so beautiful because that… what the Devi demanded, it is actually the right answer at the very highest level of the yogī. He becomes capable of bestowing grace on the world. *Lokānugrahakāmyayā*. "He has the desire to bestow grace." *Lokānugrahakāmyayā*: "The desire to bestow grace on the world." And on all living beings, *sarvaprāṇeṣu*, "on all living beings." And Śrī Nārāyaṇa says what I just uh… mentioned, "The meaning is that he who is established in this gnosis becomes capable of bestowing grace on the world." He naturally (is) capable. Now he tells this supreme gnosis for being qualified. But "gnosis" are translated– *jñāna*. 52: 

> "He is called mṛtyuñjaya, conqueror of death, eternal, supreme form. Nothing is beyond him. And declaring this is his truth, the supreme attainment."

Śiva asserts on this teaching: "This is the truth." And Śrī Nārāyaṇa here is also a very good teacher. For the purpose of making firm the faith of the disciples, and because of the great importance of this teaching, he explains repeatedly the expressed meaning with great respect. This is for teachers. Important things have to be repeated. So uh… yes, now 53 to 54 AB.

> "I have revealed this supreme nectar as threefold. By its practice, living beings have become equal to Ambā, for the sake of themselves and for others. O Goddess, without doubt, this is my true judgment."

It was also the visit now. So, human beings or living beings can become mṛtyuñjit. Then we have the complete, you know, the trinity of *nara*, *śakti*, Śiva. So, *śakti*, we have in the *sūkṣma dhārana*. Śiva in this *parādhāna*. But then, *nara* means our human existence is also included because we have the capacity to become Śiva. And that's why *nara* is also mentioned. That's this… that was… And how to retain that word "mṛtyuñjit," that this is very beautiful. Now, those of you who have uh… read or studied the Vijnābhairava, you know that there is a number of teachings of practices, *dharmas*, or whatever you call it. And at the end of the series, then He says, "Wherever you fix your mind, there Self, that (is) it." But that cannot come in the beginning. It can only come when they have already experienced this state. And then, you can universalize it. So that by whichever method, and wherever one meditates, by that very inner state, the yogī becomes equal to time. And that is this "yatra yatra" there "yena yena". So, by whichever method. It's completely open to whatever you choose. But there must be a certain experience (that) must already happen. Now if you say this in the beginning, and I have (a) very bad experience in certain systems. And they say, "Oh, wonderful. If this, by any method…"
