One moment. One moment. This chapter is ah *ākāśamāne* on the list of *ślokas*. And that too at the...

It is significant that the Chapter 8 itself does not call itself *upāya* or, uh, yoga. But immediately in the first verse, it calls itself *mṛtyuṃ jayaṃ*, that which conquers that, uh, highest *dhyāna*, which is a conqueror of death. So, Śiva speaks now about the the supreme meditation, the highest Chapter 1. Now, now, sorry, sorry, sorry. What they want? Only one and two for the time being? 

Yeah, there is, uh, many *śloka* describing *Paratattva*, which we don't have in musical form, but I'm just reading the translation, and then we recite the the text. Glorious is the Eye, the conqueror of death, which is one's own light, the great light of consciousness. Beautiful with the movement of vibration and abundance of intense bliss. 

And then Kṣemarāja introduces with a brief sentence after describing the subtle meditation: "The Blessed Lord spoke in order to expound the supreme meditation *Paratattva*." 

Now, we can recite from verse one. Only one and two for the time being? 

> *Amṛtaṃ jayaṃ nityaṃ paraṃ caivā tucchate*  
> *yat prāpyābhavati tacchāyeva te divi*  
> *yogi samāpatti sarvadṛk sarvakṛt śivā*  
> *tataḥ kathamiśyāmi yasmmāt tataḥ nitya te*. 

Oh, dear one. Now, I will reveal the supreme eternal *mṛtyuṃ jayaṃ*. After attaining him, one does not return to this three-fold world of mortals. 

And Kṣemarāja says the word "now" is used in order to explain the continuity with the subtle meditation. Eternal is that *mṛtyuṃ jayaṃ*, conqueror of death, who swallows time. And this is very significant because here the the *Paratattva* is both called *mṛtyuṃ jayaṃ* and *kālakāsaḥ*, "that which swallows time". Swallowing death and time, or overcoming death and overcoming time, is already indicated by the very word *kāla*, but it is also very consciously used in the Trika Tantra, *kālakāsaḥ*. 

The supreme means the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord, *param anuttaram parameśvarasvarūpam*. Threefold means in relation to existence, non-existence, and the transcendent, which are connected with *māyā*, *śāntyatītā* and *śuddha*. 

***Param anuttaram parameśvarasvarūpam*** Here, it is really a question of the highest absolute which the yogi attains and he already is. And that is the starting point. It is, as I quoted in the beginning, the starting point is the ending point. But in between, a lot is happening. It's not just… otherwise, one verse would have been sufficient. 

Here the Yogi and the context of *parajñāna*... the Yogi is... well, so not only he called *parayogi*, but it is supposed to be a very high level *parayogi*, not the beginner. He must have already attained a high state of experience. So, this *Parajñāna* is directly related to the absolute, to the nature of the Supreme Lord, *Parameśvara svarūpam*. 

Now, maybe it is also important to clarify at the outset that the previous, uh, ways, that is *sthūla* and *sūkṣma* and, as in the *Tantra-loka*, the *aṇavopaya* and *śāktopaya*: Every Yoga leads to the goal. It is not that the *sthūla* stops somewhere. Ultimately, every Yoga leads to the goal. And this is the great, uh, positive and joyful message of the whole spirituality, because even if you are at the lower level and you proceed slowly, or you have some impediments, obstacles, etc., ultimately, every Yoga leads to the goal. And that Upanishad makes it very clear in the *Tantra-lokas*. Whether you travel by the *aṇavopaya* or by *śāktopaya* or by *śāmbavopāya*… Of course, it is also stated there that the higher the level, the easier in a way. But "easy" in the sense that it requires a high level of consciousness. Ultimately, the three levels correspond to three levels of consciousness. But through each one, the practitioner, the Yogi, reaches the goal sooner or later. And of course, the later, the more trouble you have to make, more effort. 

But, uh, here we are already at the highest level of both: the Yogi was a *parayogi* and Shiva at… in his form *anuttara* means the unsurpassable, transcendent one. 

Then verse two:

> *The Yogi shines as Shiva.* 
> *He immediately Omnipresent, all knowing and all doing.* 
> *I will reveal this knowledge after which one needs no further knowledge.* 

So, if this is really taken in its fullness, it can lead you directly to that divine nature. So, Yogi already shines… partly shines as Shiva. And, as we have seen, Shiva is the one who is all pervasive and who is, of course, all-knowing and only… only present and only potent, etc. So, the Yogi will discuss that at that level. And Shiva promises here to reveal that that knowledge… again, well, knowledge after which one does not need any other knowledge. 

Now… and that is not an analogy to be taken literally. Now, we can recite, uh, from three to seven… What? To each every… 

> *yat prāpya tanmayaḥ tadvedanaṃ bhāvayacārāmaḥ*  
> *yam vāgbhavati nityam yan na dṛśyate cakṣuṣā*  
> *yat śrotavyam karṇaiḥ nāśakyam jñātum dehī*  
> *yanna svādayate jihvā nāspṛśecyattvagindriyam*  
> *na cetaścintanīyam sarvavarnairaśucitam*  
> *sarvavarnairaṣa yuktam prayeṇeti ndriyam*  
> *yat prāpya yogino devī bhavanti jagadgurvāḥ.*  
> *tad brahmasinā mahatā vairāgyeṇa pāreṇa ca.*
> *rāgadveṣaparityāgalobhamohakṣayakriye*
> *madamasaryasaṃjñākaṃ māna karmavatkṣayaḥ* 
> *labhyate śāśvatamn்ityam śivam avyayam uttamam*

Now, Kṣemarāja immediately, uh, speaks of the *parayogi*, the Supreme Yogi, who is certainly not subject to old age and death because he is not touched by the limited subjectivity identified with the body, etc. That which is prone to death is our limited individuality identified with this body, this *karma*, this mind, etc., etc. That is what is prone to death. But the *parayogi* has already given up that identification. 

And now, from the second half of three to five, it is very brief, but is a kind of *upaniṣadic* like, uh, "negative theology" that this ultimate reality cannot attain… be attained by any sense organ or by any, uh, by thought or by sense, uh, perception, etc. It is so brief, but it, uh, reflects, like in the Upanishad: “He cannot be seen by the eye. He cannot be heard by the ear," etc., etc. Of course, *Upanishad Kena Upanishad*, for example, which contains all that, uh, negation of the Vedānta Upanishads in general. That ultimate reality cannot be objectified. It cannot be made an object of thought or of feeling or of a sense experience, etc. 

> *Yanna vākavadate nityam yat na vaktuṃ śakyate'nabhilṣaṇīyam avyaktam yan na paśyanti paśyanti yanna śṛṇvanti śṛṇvanti yanna vijānanti jīvantaṃ tad viddhi cenna vedasi mahati vināśti* 

That which cannot be expressed by words, which is eternal, which cannot be seen by the eyes, which cannot be heard by the ears, which cannot be smelled by the nose, which cannot be tasted by the tongue, which cannot be felt by the tactual sense, which cannot be conceived by the mind. 

So, this… all *upaniṣadic* negations of the… its incapacity to experience that reality by what is given to us: the senses, the mind, etc., etc. 

Which is free from color and taste… Up to here, it is Upanishad: negative, negative. Neither this nor that… But then, after all itself *tantra*. So he cannot completely leave out the senses. Then he says it is free from color and taste, and yet it is endowed with every color and every taste. So this, uh, is the coincidence of opposites. It's free from all sense perceptions, and yet it is endowed with all sense perceptions. Which is immeasurable, beyond the senses, etc. 

And attaining that, O goddess, the Yogi becomes ageless and deathless by the great practice and Supreme renunciation. 

Now all comes our *Yoga-sūtra*, uh, then the *sūtra*: *abyāsa vairāgyābhyāṃ* and Shiva… for the students of *Shiva Veda* know it better than I… uh, by practice and renunciation. Now, all this commentary is on the *Yoga-sūtra* we have to also compare. 

But what is interesting is that… and if the divine is a coincidence of opposites, so is the Yogi. Because although he is already divine, he is already Shiva. And yet he has also to practice something. To fulfill that what he already is. 

And what we were missing in the, uh, *sthūla tanmātra* and *sūkṣma tanmātra*, there was no emphasis on any ethical preparation for this Yoga. And it comes precisely here at the highest level. This is very interesting because in the *sūkṣma tanmātra* also he could have said: "Renounce all the desires and all the *suranāga*," but he doesn't say that. As if there is no condition. But here, at the *parayogi*, he has to be already so pure and so totally, uh, free from all these things which he now mentions. 

> *By completely renouncing passion and hatred* (rāgadveṣa) *and by dissolving greed and delusion* (lobhamoha) *by renouncing intoxication and jealousy, by destroying ego and pride, the Yogi attains the eternal, ever new Shiva, indestructible supreme.* 

It's very interesting that this ethical conditions for the highest Yoga… they are mentioned here and not before. And what many popular, uh, people who think of Shiva that he is always intoxicated, etc. The *tantras* are very clear that, mother, this intoxication is to be avoided. The popular ideas: “Oh, Shiva is always taking *ganja* and so on.” So Vyāsa… but… as he…  *madamasaryasaṃjñākaṃ māna karmavatkṣayaḥ*… 

The Yogi obtains the eternal, ever-new Shiva… by translating *shivaśāśvata* and *nitya* is more or less synonymous, but, uh, *nitya* means also something which is every time new, as if you do *nitya pūjā*, you don't do it every day… that is the ever, uh, ongoing. And that's why I prefer “eternal” is something going on at endless time, but *nitya* is something which is every time renewed. So, ever new. And Shiva is ever new. Now Kṣemarāja comments on this, uh, *upaniṣadic*-like verses… we have no word of the three forms of *paryāya*…
