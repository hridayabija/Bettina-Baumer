Good morning! We start with ślokas 21, 23, and 20. 

ओम् परं परस्थं गहना गहनादिम् । 
एकं निविष्टं बहुधा बहुधाशु ।। 
सर्वात्मकं सर्वचराचरस्थं 
त्वमेव शम्भुं शरणं प्रपद्ये ।। 
परं परस्थं गहना गहनादिम् । 
एकं निविष्टं बहुधा बहुधाशु ।। 
सर्वात्मकं सर्वचराचरस्थं 
त्वमेव शम्भुं शरणं प्रपद्ये ।। 
परं परस्थं गहना गहनादिम् । 
एकं निविष्टं बहुधा बहुधाशु ।। 
सर्वात्मकं सर्वचराचरस्थं 
त्वमेव शम्भुं शरणं प्रपद्ये ।। 

The first--we see another sheet of paper, but this sheet--it is not for practice and which gives you a survey of the entire yoga of the Netra Tantra. And I consciously didn't want to give it to you at the beginning because some people--they they then stick to that, "Oh, where I leave, what is what?" We can, at the end, you can place the things in the scheme, but first we have to get into it, and we have to go through all this, uh, this wonder of that yoga. But now that we have already reached the very penultimate stage, uh, it will help you to place those practices, those aspects, into the scheme. And this I just, uh, quote the authors, by Nartive and Vasudeva, who is [a] great scholar of Kashmir Shaivism. And it is from his article on, uh, the Shiva yoga details--I will give you later. So just keep it, and, uh, whenever you can refer to it and identify things before or after during the seminar. 

Before we come back to the text, I have a little announcement. Yesterday I mentioned the pilgrimage to Kailash, and today one of our friends--she has recently made this pilgrimage and she wants to share the, uh, uh, slides now. It is, it won't--what, it slides or what is it--PowerPoint, whatever, uh, so please keep yourself free after dinner. So after dinner, we can have a slideshow, and I assure you, because I have made the pilgrimage myself, and I have shown my slides with very few--many times, and every time the viewers said it was a meditative experience. So, uh, keep yourself free in the evening.

Now, yesterday we concluded the eighth *aṅga*, *aṣṭāṅga yoga*, of the Netra, including the four aspects--four variations of *samādhi*. And it is interesting--when I mentioned this, some of them also said that this is the--if you practice any one of them, the others become obsolete. But it is not true, because the text says it at the very beginning, verse nine: 

> अष्टाङ्गेन तु योगेन आन्यात्मा अन्यतत्त्वचित्

You attain it by this eightfold yoga and not otherwise. But of course, this eightfold yoga is interpreted as we have seen at another level, which, because the, the transcendental level and to compare it with the, the *Bhagavad Gītā*, which, uh, some of them has also done--the *Bhagavad Gītā* itself says that if you practice only one, you can reach the ultimate, and it is not said here. So I believe that just texts which are, after all, uh, revelation, that here it is good to practice all of the four types of *samādhi*. Of course, it depends, uh, uh, it doesn't mean we have to practice all of them, but at least one, because that depends on your disposition, on your capacity, and on your level, *et cetera*, *et cetera*. But the others are definitely recommended.

So we come to the concluding verses of this *aṣṭāṅga yoga*, and we can recite maybe from 21 to 25, maybe.

> एवं अष्टाङ्ग योगेन स्वभाव सम्परन्तुभं 
दृष्ट्वा वञ्चयते कालं अमृतेषं परं विभुं 
मृत्युजित्स्व भवे देवि न कालः कालयते तम् ।। 
तत्त्वषट्त्रिंश तस्यागा द् उभा नन्द्य वर्जना 
एकाशीतिपदो त्वं वै वर्ण पञ्चाशतापरं 
व्यापकं सर्वमन्त्रेषु सर्वैश्वैव हि जीवनम् ।। 
अष्टात्रिंशत्कलोत्वन्तु सर्वां तत्सर्वमध्यगं 
आदिर मध्यं न चैवान्तो लभ्यते यस्य केन चे 
तत्परमेय मतुत्तं प्राप्त्य सर्वं न लभ्यते

So I can--they're concluding, uh, statement after going through this *aṣṭāṅga yoga*. 

The one who by this eightfold yoga is firmly established in this *pūrṇa* supreme nature--*svabhāva santānatva*--this is very important. We have *svarūpa* and *svabhāva* here, the synonyms. He [is] established in one's own supreme nature for the *pūrṇa*. With this realization, he conquers time and becomes the supreme lord and creation. Who conquers--he becomes the conqueror of death, and time cannot affect him any longer. *Akāla kalayate tam*. So all this is [an] equation of time and death. *Kālan*  also means fragmentation. What time does is also to create fragmentation in our life. It is not already--there is fragmented, but through *kāla*, uh, which has so many meanings, five basic meanings, and here also in the sense of dividing time, events. 

And here's a direct, uh, hint at the difference from Vedānta, when, when Shiva says by saying this, "Without the prescriptions given in other Shastras, such as *ahiṃsā*, *satya*, *et cetera*, *et cetera*, and the *yamas*, he attains the supreme lord and creation, the lord of consciousness." Any Shastra is of course basically--but Vedānta, but of course all those who follow the *yamas* and *niyamas*. The supreme all-pervading lord, who is without support because of everything, having experienced that, he conquers time and becomes a unified intensity of the bliss of consciousness without fragmentation of time.

Now, we have said several times that when the *yogī* reaches the highest state, he gets--obtains the qualities of Shiva, which are like *vyāpaka*, pervasive, and full of bliss and consciousness. But here the other characteristic of Shiva is, uh, supportless. And till we reach that high state, we always need a support, whether physical, mental, spiritual, uh, social, all kinds of supports. And the, the *Bhagavad Gītā* has a number of *karaṇas* teaching you for practicing the state of supportlessness, and it starts with a meditation on physical supportlessness. That you meditate you're sitting, but you're sitting on nothing. So these are steps by which slowly one overcomes the dependence on the support. It's a beautiful meditation: meditating that there is nothing under you. There's no, uh, no seat, no *āsana*, nothing under you. It is a very--but this is a *bhāvanā*. We have been talking about *bhāvanā* and trying to define, *et cetera*, but this is a typical example of *bhāvanā*. It doesn't mean that there is nothing, but he imagines in a very strong meditation, he just thinks and he imagines that there is nothing--this is *bhāvanā*--and then by that imagination, he actually experiences. So these are steps to attain that supportless state. And this is a very important aspect of the entire practice, and then there are other examples in the *Bhagavad Gītā*.

So we have seen earlier also in the other earlier practices, also through *upamāna*, that whenever the *yogī* reaches the goal of that particular yoga, form of yoga, he becomes like Shiva and he overcomes time. But here, of course, we are at a level of *parā tantra*. So it is definitely a higher state, and now, uh, the *yogī* is described as having transcended all kinds of, uh, limitations and identifications. And the first is the 36 *tattva*. 36 *tattva* constitute the entire cosmology and so on of, uh, Shaivism. But as we've seen, even Shiva as a *tattva* has to be transcended to the, uh, highest *anuttara*, the supreme Shiva. So: 

> He has renounced the 36 tattvas and has discarded all the infinite worlds, *pūrṇas*. He is above the eighty-first and beyond the 50 phonemes.

Now, at first, this is connected with elements of language. Uh, phonemes, 50 phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet. And at first--I'm not going to [go into] these technicalities, but he has transcended language. It's not clearly there. He--beyond the 50 phonemes--means beyond language.

> He pervades all the mantras. He is the life in every being. 

This is very--he possesses so much.

> United with--he's the life in everybody. Being beyond the 36 *kalās*, and don't ask me what those technicalities, uh, because we have to--anyway, that will be given in the book, but not today. We have to reach the end of the text. Now this is beautiful.

> Being the end of all, he is in the center of everything. Being the end of all, he's in the center of everything. *Sarvamat sarvāntas sarvamatīkramāt*.

And this, as I told you, in the case of *samādhi*, states which are described as something very final, very firm, *et cetera*, but they can also be used as, uh, bases for *pātanā*, for meditation. You can meditate that I am in the center of everything. That will be a *pātanā*. It will not be an achievement, but by that, you get into that state, in that experience gradually, which otherwise would be achieved suddenly by grace. But: 

> Nobody can know his beginning, middle, or end. But he attains everything, being immeasurable and incomparable.

Tremendous description of that reality. I'm just looking at the commentary, if there's something to be picked out here. He's at the center. He's the life of all, and beginning and the end of all, and being of such nature, he's at the center of the universe, and nobody can attain his beginning, middle, or end, because he transcends space and time. And therefore, being beyond duality, he is unknowable and immeasurable. And the last sentence in his commentary is: 

> Being *moti* intellectually attained is the state of *ambikēśvara-bhairava*, who is all in all.

Now this "all in all" is, uh, maybe I mentioned it before, it is a fundamental theory of, of Kashmir Śaivism, which is expounded by Abhinavagupta, *et cetera*. *Sarvam sarvātmakam*. All in all is one translation, but what it also implies is that everything is containing everything else, or every particle of the universe contains the totality. This is a fantastic doctrine. It's not a philosophical--not even developed, so, philosophically, but it is based on, exactly on this spiritual experience of the *yogī*. But it is developed in all kinds of contexts, from the cosmic to the body, to every, every aspect of, uh, reality. And who is *sarvasarvātmaka*? It is *parameśvara-bhairava*, the Lord himself, is the one who contains all in all. That's prophetic. Even in a fragment, the whole is there. 25 CD. 

> Since the entire world is filled by one immeasurable, knowing him one is quickly released from the terrible bondage of *saṁsāra*.

And Śivānanda immediately says:

> "Knowing" means ascertaining firmly.

Again, he has the same doubt like me, that knowing is not an intellectual knowledge--that doesn't help you--but it has to be firmly, uh, there, given for being invested there when, when, so, yeah. 

> However, one is liberated from the three principles. Then one becomes eternal, unmoved, and stable. 

That is 26.

> By this divine path of yoga, one is not born again. Liberated from all the sense organs, one realizes the unknowable beyond suffering. 

I read--yeah. Yes. We've only, uh, chanted until 25 AB. 25 AB? What you're reading, you've not chanted now. We have only recited till 25 AB. It's 20--yeah. Then five elements in Sanskrit. Now we have no--we haven't reached 25. Second half? Yeah. We have not chanted 25 yet. Okay, no, no. Sorry. Until it gets--So we recite from 25 CD to, to 28. So we can--the whole of 25.

> *tat aprameyam atulam prāpya sarvam na labhyate*
> *yenaikena jagat sarvam aprameyena pūritam*
> *tasmāt ātmā utpadyate śiśupra--*
> *khura-saṁsāra-bandhanā. tatvatraya-vinirmuktam*
> *śāśvatam acalam dhruvam divyena yoga-mārgeṇa*
> *dṛśvā bhūyo na jāyate sarvendriya-vinirmuktam*
> *avedyam jāpyam ātmānam paramātma-svarūpam tu*
> *sarvopādhi-vivarjitam chaitanyam ātmāno rūpam*
> *sarvaśāstreṣu kathyate*

Now we can--the whole of 25. When he says he is liberated from, from the three principles, it's something very astonishing. And Śivānanda says: 

> The three principles of *māyāśakti Śiva*. 

It's the highest, but even transcending any division, because he reached that unity. So any--we make this categories in order to understand, uh, the functioning and, uh, the processes of the divine in the world, *et cetera*, but even this threefold division of *māyāśakti Śiva* has to be transcended. And, uh, Śivānanda considers--also replies to different philosophical doctrines. Uh, he responds to *Vivartavāda*. That is a doctrine of change. Unmoved means changeless, which means constant. 

> Having perceived the unknowable by means of the divine path of yoga, this is--that is the establishment in the reflection beyond thought, which awakens by the dissolution of thoughts. The sage claims, "Having realized directly, he is not born again." 

So this, uh, beyond thought, *vikalpa-rahita*. So by the dissolution of *vikalpas*, of thought constructs. And now he introduces, uh--introduction to verse 28. Having attained the Supreme Reality, which bestows liberation by means of *ānanda-śakti* and *sambandhopāya*, he states that:

> Only the goal as per this tradition, not only the goal as per this tradition, but according to all the scriptures. 

And this is a beautiful--one of the beautiful aspects of the tantra, that universality. It is not only Śaivism or Advaita Śaivism or Trika, or whatever you call it, but *sarvaśāstreṣu*, in all the scriptures. This is quite unique. So verse 28.

> The essential nature of the Supreme Self, free from all superimpositions, the form of consciousness, is praised in all the scriptures. 

It's, uh, so universal. And as I told you in the beginning, even within tantra itself, and of course the different deities and different manifestations of Shiva-vision, *et cetera*, but the crucial point here is *chaitanyam ātmāno rūpam*, because he is of the form of pure consciousness. And that nobody can deny that, whether you are a Muslim or a Christian or a Buddhist, or whatever, but still, consciousness--there is something completely free from any, uh, but this--
