## Who is seated on the Āsana?

> Who is seated on the *āsana*, of his own energy of awareness.

This is very subtle. This verse is so important because, as we have seen, Yama and Niyama, he has very quickly dealt with. And just by these two attitudes: renouncing the world and the aim in concept contemplation of the Supreme reality. 

But the actual practice starts with *āsana*, which is a way of merging into that pervasion of consciousness, *citta-vṛtti*.  *Macanam*, *citta-vṛtti* upon *manasanam*, merging into the pervasion of consciousness, which is of the nature of disciplined thought. And being seated on his own energy of awareness, that is what *āsana* means; by sitting, no? 

This time, based on this *āsana*, it already has a basis. So, that is the basis. It's not a physical basis, but it is a basis in that power of awareness, from which everything else unfolds. You just have to be seated there and then develop that subtle power of awareness, which is the divine and which is the pervasion of consciousness. *Citta-vṛtti*. 

And that power comes by-- of that 12 and 13, maybe:

> *prāṇādi-śūnyam-bhavan-tu tattvā-sūkṣma-mātaram*
>
> *sūkṣmātītaṁ paramaṁ spandanaṁ labhyate yaḥ*
>
> *prāṇāyāma-sūteṣṭho yasmann-acyavate punaḥ*

That I will discuss tomorrow. 

You want to-- you want to quote the-- the subsequent line also. Ah, let's see. Someone read. What was it? It is very-- what was it? Maybe in the afternoon we can bring the-- the *ubhayaḥ*, and we can come back to that commentary. 

## Regulation of Prāṇa

Regulation, regulation of the-- the breathing. Yeah. Most of the time, it's regulation of *prāṇa*. Yeah, yeah, that would-- like to answer. 

See, what the letter does is that every *aṅga* is transported at the parallel. It's not denying the other *aṅgas*. But because it's dealing *para-prāṇāyāma*, so it transports it to a Supreme level. The abandoning the gross state of *prāṇa*, etcetera, as well as the subtle one. With them, one thereby attains a supreme vibration beyond the subtle. That's again, they have this tendency, you know, to be from gross to subtle, to more subtle, more subtle, ever a continuous process of-- 

So, abandoning the-- the gross *prāṇa*, that is understandable. And even the subtle one. And transcending even the subtle. And what is *prāṇa*, actually? So, if you think, what is *āsana*? *Āsana* is something which you base your practice on, and whether internally or externally. Normally, Yama is considered externally. *Sthira-sukha-āsana*, that is external. But that on which you're based, and *prāṇāyāma* is to go to the source, what is the *prāṇa*, that is vibration. It is a vibration, which is even beyond the subtle. *Parama-spandanam*. So, that's where your awareness has become so subtle, you need so much practice over and so on, to catch hold of that vibration. That, in the most-- most subtle vibration, from where *prāṇa* springs, or which is the basis of *prāṇa*. *Parama-spandanam*. It's just to be only aware of that subtle, most vibration. 

So, it is not-- *spandanā* also came in the *sūkṣma-prāṇāyāma*, uh, that the whole process of arising of the energy starts with the vibration of the *mūlādhāra*, etcetera. But that is already, no? That is *sūkṣma*, but it is not *sūkṣmātīta*. *Sūkṣma*, but it is not the-- of the utmost subtlety. 

## Commentary on Prāṇāyāma

So, here, again, I take the commentary. 

> Beginning with *prāṇa*, one should abandon that. This one should give up the gross state of *recaka*, *pūraka*, etcetera.

So, all this *haṭha-yogic prāṇāyāma*, uh, which are literally practiced with *prāṇa*, *apāna*, and *samāna*. 

> And the-- the intermediary state of the gross *prāṇāyāma*, in the middle part, which is subtle. One should, again, give up the forms of expelling and taking in, etcetera, of the--

> Then, from there, one attains the supreme vibration, which is even beyond the subtle, and which is of the nature of a pervasion of consciousness. That's where it is. *Sūkṣmamati- atītaṁ paraṁ iti prāṇaḥ ādi citta-sphurat-ātma-spandanāt*.

Now, this *spanda*, if you imagine vibration as something physical, whether in the body, or, of course, if you think of physics, uh, there is this vibration of cosmos, macrocosmos, etcetera. But it is not a physical vibration. *Cit-spandana*, it is the function of the Supreme form of consciousness. 

So, that's where *prāṇa*, *spanda*, uh, *citta*, they are different-- together. Consciousness, which is, of course, manifested in *prāṇa*, but the-- the subtlest manifestation is that vibration. *Cit-sphuratā*, it's a very beautiful term, which is effervescence also, in the sense of, uh, light. The all kinds of energy, they arise from that *spanda*, from that subtle vibration. And the energy of all this process-- thank you. 

> *Tasmin sati śvāsa-praśvāsayor-gati-vicchedaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ.*

So, Swami Vivekananda's translation:

> When that posture, *āsana*, has been accomplished, breaking the force and uncontrolled movement of inhalation and exhalation, is termed breath control and expansion of *prāṇa*.

Yeah. Now, you see the difference here. That is, first of all, no question of effort. And, uh, and even overcoming the duality of breathing and breathing out, uh, *prāṇa-apāna*, uh, here, the *śvāsa-praśvāsa*, uh, rituals. Yeah. 

So, going to the very, very base of the energy of *prāṇa*, in the vibration, *spandanā*, which is in a pervasion of consciousness, *cit-sphuratā*. *Asphuratā* implies that the-- or it implies also light. *Spandanā* is very much used in this as a characteristic of *śakti*. *Śakti* is *spanda*. It's a pulsation, it's a flashing forth and a flashing forth. But in that most subtle vibration. 

Therefore, the supreme vibration is beyond the gross and the subtle divisions of restrained breaths. This is the discipline of the nature of the pacified manifestation, pacified manifestation-- on stay. Which has been explained in its highest form.

Therefore, taking recourse to this *prāṇāyāma*, one does not fall again. Which means one never leaves the state of one's pure nature of consciousness.  I have practically pacified, uh, manifestation of consciousness. 

> *Praśāmita-svabhāvā avabhāsa-ātmanaḥ*
> 
> *Cit-praṇati-the Cit-praṇati-mayatām na-gāda-cit jahāti,*

He never-- he never, he never leaves the state of one's pure nature of consciousness. Because that *spandanā*, that vibration is the vibration of consciousness, and that *prāṇa* is a--  manifestation of the subtle and the gross, uh, it is-- becomes more and more gross.

## Pratyāhāra: Reverse Movement of the Mind

Now comes *pratyāhāra*. What we also understand-- if you can read the definition of *pratyāhāra*: 

> *śalabhiṣayāsaṁ pratyāhāram*

Chapter 2, verse 54 is the last *sūtra* and Chapter 2-- it's chapter's translation:

> When the senses cease conjunction with the objects in their realm, they thereby become as it were assimilated with the mind field's nature. That is called *pratyāhāra*.

Yeah. So, we can understand that then, for them-- let us do the whole chapter then, because it's easier to understand:

> Leaving aside even the subtle sounds, which are modes of sensation caused by the *guṇas* of *prakṛti* and are experienced only by the mind, one should enter the highest state with one's own consciousness. This is called the real *pratyāhāra*. This cuts away the noose of the transmigratory existence.

So, it is not just the withdrawal of the senses from the objects, which is the common understanding and the-- and the practices. But even the *guṇas* of *prakṛti*: *śabda*, this, *pada*, all that is included-- commentary and, um, yeah. 

> That which he experiences by his mind, that is his consciousness of the qualities of the form of *śabda*, etcetera-- subtle *rajas, tamas* of the subtle sounds, touch, etcetera, of all the senses, of the states of these modes of sensation-- giving them up, that is abandoning them with indifference. He enters in the supreme abode of consciousness by reflective awareness-- not reflective awareness, the other, the *vimarsha*. 

Yeah. 

> *satcitānanda vikalpasambhit paramṛśet paramṛśa paracittāmavāpnoti*

Enters the supreme abode of consciousness. 

Hence, *pratyāhāra* is of the nature of the reverse movement of the mind, which is an outflow from the level of consciousness back towards its source. Thus, it cuts the noose of transmigratory existence. 

So, *pratyāhāra*, *prati* also means reverse. *Pratyāhāra*. So, it's a literal analysis of *pratyāhāra*. The-- the normal flow of the senses is outward, like they got-- *Upanishad* says. But the reverse flow, *prati*. That *prati*, that karma-- karma *pratyāhāra*. That's the-- yeah.

Here it goes on, and the fundamental idea is the same: to withdraw from the-- the senses from the objects, but not in the external sense. But at the level of the-- even the *guṇas* of *prakṛti*, at the modes of *citta*. In every-- under the-- 

He aims at-- here means reverse. If you see this *sūtra* also means:

> He aims at establishing the yogi in a state that is not-- uh, from where it does not fall. 

Because we know this, uh, all that *abhyāsa* with-- uh, we are describing the *Yoga Sūtra*, they have to be repeated. They have to be practiced repeatedly. 

But here, he aims at a state: once you are there, that subtle vibration or that, uh, at the *sāman*, uh, then it becomes something permanent. And that means that the yogi should be so much established in those numbers. He doesn't have to go and repeat it repeatedly. And repetition is also-- we were talking about the *abhyāsa*. Repetition is a sign of *anabhyāsa*, of the doubt commits which depends on the-- by the individual-- on the individual. 

As long as we are identified with our bodily mind, that we have to go repeatedly. *Abhyāsa* is a continuous repetition. Until we reach this state, we have the same *sāman*. *Āsana* of *pratyāhāra* reaches a level where you don't have to repeat it anymore because you have lived the very basics of that practice. 

In a sense, the-- the *tanmayi* and this, uh, complement-- just here it goes one step higher to that parallel. I think this topic is of *tanmayi* is so important that we should do it-- we have to do it, study, uh, especially as we shall see in the afternoon, the *samādhi*. There are four kinds of *samādhi* here. This is very important. 

So, what is *tanmayi* and all the *samādhis* busy-- let us do that in the afternoon with full, uh, concentration. Because, uh, I'm keeping the *tanmayi* to compare-- yes. So, if you have questions, you can better write them because we are just too many. Write them down and--
