##A Journey into the Depths of Yogic Practice: Unfolding the Subtle DimensionsThis expanded commentary embarks on a deeper exploration of the core concepts discussed,elucidating the subtle nuances of *āsana*, *prāṇāyāma*, and *pratyāhāra* and their profound significance in the yogic journey.

### Who is Seated on the Āsana?: Unveiling the True Seat of Practice

The question "Who is seated on the *āsana*?" serves as a profound inquiry into the very nature of yogic practice. It challenges the common perception of *āsana* as merely a physical posture and directs our attention to the subtler aspects of awareness and consciousness that form thetrue foundation of yoga.

**Āsana: Beyond the Physical Form**:

The term *āsana* is often translated as "posture" or "seat," leading to a limited understanding of its true meaning. While the physical aspectof *āsana* is important, particularly in Hatha Yoga, it is merely a stepping stone to a deeper experience. The true *āsana* is not the physical body contorting itself into a shape, but rather the establishment of the mind in a state of steadiness, clarity, and awareness.

**The Energy of Awareness**:

The phrase "energy of awareness" points to a vital aspect of *āsana*. Awareness, in yogic terms, is not merely a passive observation of thoughts and sensations. It is an active, dynamic force, a potent energy that has the power to transform both body and mind. Whenwe sit in *āsana*, we are not merely assuming a physical form but cultivating this energy of awareness, allowing it to permeate our entire being.

**Shifting from External to Internal**:

The transition from Yama and Niyama to *āsana* marks a crucial shift in yogic practice. Yama andNiyama, the first two limbs of Patanjali's eightfold path, deal primarily with our external conduct – our ethical behavior and personal observances. While these are essential foundations, true transformation occurs when we turn our attention inwards, exploring the subtler landscapes of the mind and consciousness. This is where *āsana* plays a pivotal role.

**The Foundation of Awareness**:

The text emphasizes that this cultivated awareness, this "energy of awareness," becomes the bedrock upon which all other yogic practices rest. Just as a building needs a strong foundation to stand tall, so too does our yogic journey require a stable andgrounded awareness. From this place of inner stability, all other practices – *prāṇāyāma*, *pratyāhāra*, *dhāraṇā*, *dhyāna*, and *samādhi* – can unfold naturally and effortlessly.

**Cultivating the Divine Spark**:

The "subtlepower of awareness" is described as both divine and the essence of *citta-vṛtti* – the fluctuations of the mind. This points to the transformative potential of *āsana*. By cultivating awareness, we tap into a power that is inherent within us, a divine spark that has the potential to illuminate ourentire being. This awareness is not something separate from us, but rather our true nature, often obscured by the incessant chatter of the mind.

In essence, the question "Who is seated on the *āsana*?" is a call to go beyond the superficial aspects of yoga and delve into the depths of our being. It is a reminder that true yoga is not about achieving external perfection but about realizing the infinite potential of our own awareness.

### Regulation of Prāṇa: Unveiling the Subtlest Vibration of Life

Moving beyond the confines of breath control, this section delves into the deeper dimensions of *prāṇāyāma*, revealing its profound connection to the very essence of life force itself.

**Prāṇa: Beyond Mere Breath**:

While *prāṇāyāma* is commonly translated as "breath control," this interpretation barely scratches the surface of its true meaning. *Prāṇa*, in yogicphilosophy, is not merely the air we breathe but the vital life force that permeates our entire being, animating our physical body, energy body, and mind. It is the subtle energy that flows through our *nāḍīs* (energy channels), sustaining and nourishing us on all levels.

**The Spectrum ofVibration**:

The text describes *prāṇa* as a "vibration" that exists on a spectrum, ranging from the gross to the subtle and beyond. This concept of *prāṇa* as vibration aligns with modern physics, which posits that everything in the universe is ultimately energy vibrating at different frequencies.The grossest manifestation of *prāṇa* is the breath, which can be regulated through various techniques. However, as we refine our awareness, we can access subtler and subtler levels of this life force.

**Parama-Spandanam: The Source Vibration**:

At the subtlest endof this spectrum lies *parama-spandanam* – the supreme vibration. This is not a physical vibration that can be perceived by the senses, but rather the primordial vibration from which all other manifestations of *prāṇa* arise. It is the very source of life itself, the pulsating energy that sustainsthe entire cosmos.

**Transcending the Gross and Subtle**:

True *prāṇāyāma*, as described in the text, involves transcending both the gross and subtle levels of *prāṇa*. It is not about manipulating the breath for specific physiological effects but about attuning our awareness to the*parama-spandanam* – the subtlest vibration of life force that permeates our very being. This requires a deep level of sensitivity and an ability to quiet the mind and senses, allowing us to perceive the subtlest movements of energy within.

**Sūkṣma-Prāṇāyāma: A Stepping Stone**:

The text distinguishes between *sūkṣma-prāṇāyāma* and the *prāṇāyāma* that leads to *parama-spandanam*. *Sūkṣma-prāṇāyāma* involves workingwith the subtle energies associated with the chakras, particularly the *mūlādhāra* chakra located at the base of the spine. While this is a valuable practice, it is still considered *sūkṣma* (subtle) and not *sūkṣmātīta* (beyond subtle).**Cit-Sphuratā: The Effervescence of Consciousness**:

The term *cit-sphuratā*, used to describe the nature of *parama-spandanam*, beautifully captures the dynamic and luminous quality of this supreme vibration. It suggests an effervescence of consciousness, a vibrant and radiant energythat is the source of all creation.

**The Interplay of Prāṇa, Spanda, and Citta**:

This discussion highlights the interconnectedness of *prāṇa* (life force), *spanda* (vibration), and *citta* (consciousness). *Prāṇa* isthe vehicle through which consciousness manifests. *Spanda* is the fundamental nature of both *prāṇa* and consciousness – a dynamic, pulsating energy that is constantly in motion. By attuning to the subtlest vibration of *prāṇa*, we connect with the very source of consciousness itself.**Breaking Free from Dualities**:

Swami Vivekananda's translation of Patanjali's *Yoga Sūtras* emphasizes that true *prāṇāyāma* is not about forcefully controlling the breath but rather a natural consequence of being established in *āsana* – a state ofsteadiness, awareness, and equanimity. From this place of inner balance, the fluctuations of inhalation and exhalation (*śvāsa-praśvāsa*) dissolve, and we rest in the effortless flow of *prāṇa*.

**The Discipline of Pacified Manifestation**:

Mastering *prāṇāyāma* is not merely a physical exercise but a profound spiritual practice. It is described as the "discipline of the nature of the pacified manifestation" – a state where the mind is still, the senses are at rest, and we abide in the stillness of pure awareness. This state is not achievedthrough force but through consistent practice, patience, and a deep reverence for the life force that animates us all.

**Abode in Pure Consciousness**:

This level of *prāṇāyāma* leads to a permanent state of abiding in one's true nature, described as *praśāmita-svabhāvā avabhāsa-ātmanaḥ* – the pacified manifestation of consciousness. In this state, the yogi never strays from the awareness of pure consciousness (*cit-praṇati-the Cit-praṇati-mayatām na-gāda-cit jahāti*) because their very being is merged with the subtlest vibration of *prāṇa*, the source of all life and consciousness.

In essence, the practice of *prāṇāyāma* is a journey into the very heart of existence. It is about connecting with the subtlest vibration of lifeforce, the *parama-spandanam*, and realizing our inseparable connection to the source of all creation.

### Pratyāhāra: The Inward Flow of Awareness

Moving beyond the common notion of sensory withdrawal, this section explores the subtler dimensions of *pratyāhāra*, revealing its transformative powerin redirecting our awareness inward and severing the ties that bind us to the external world.

**The Conventional Understanding**:

The traditional definition of *pratyāhāra* – *śalabhiṣayāsaṁ pratyāhāram* – translates to "the senses ceasing conjunction with the objects intheir realm." This is further elaborated in the *Yoga Sūtras*: "When the senses cease conjunction with the objects in their realm, they thereby become as it were assimilated with the mind field's nature. That is called *pratyāhāra*.

**Beyond Sensory Withdrawal**:

While withdrawing the sensesfrom external stimuli is an important aspect of *pratyāhāra*, the text emphasizes that true *pratyāhāra* goes far deeper. It involves disengaging from even the subtlest objects of perception – the *guṇas* of *prakṛti*, the fundamental constituents of nature that giverise to our sensory experiences.

**The Allure of the Guṇas**:

The *guṇas* of *prakṛti* – *sattva* (purity, harmony), *rajas* (activity, passion), and *tamas* (inertia, ignorance) – are thebuilding blocks of the material world and influence everything we perceive, think, and feel. They are the subtle forces that create the illusion of a separate self and bind us to the cycle of birth and death.

**Subtle Impressions and Mental Modifications**:

Even when we physically withdraw our senses, the *guṇas* continue to exert their influence through the subtle impressions (*saṁskāras*) they leave on our minds. These *saṁskāras* are like seeds that can sprout into thoughts, desires, and emotions, pulling us back into the external world. True *pratyāhāra* involves not only withdrawingfrom external stimuli but also becoming aware of and disengaging from these subtle impressions.

**The Supreme Abode of Consciousness**:

By transcending the allure of the *guṇas* and disidentifying from the modifications of the mind (*vṛttis*), the yogi enters the "supreme abode ofconsciousness" (*satcitānanda vikalpasambhit paramṛśet paramṛśa paracittāmavāpnoti*) – a state of pure awareness, bliss, and liberation. In this state, the mind is no longer swayed by external distractions or internal turbulence, and we rest in the stillnessof our true nature.

**Reversing the Flow**:

The text describes *pratyāhāra* as a "reverse movement" of the mind. Just as a river naturally flows outward towards the ocean, so too do our senses naturally flow outward, seeking gratification in the external world. *Pratyāhāra* reverses this flow, redirecting the mind's energy inward towards its source.

**Cutting the Noose**:

This inward flow of awareness is likened to cutting the "noose of transmigratory existence" – the cycle of birth and death driven by our attachment to sensory pleasures and the illusion of a separateself. By withdrawing our senses, stilling the mind, and disengaging from the *guṇas*, we break free from this cycle and attain liberation.

**Establishing the Unshakable State**:

The *sūtra*: *"He aims at establishing the yogi in a state that is not--uh, from where it does not fall"* highlights the transformative power of *pratyāhāra*. By mastering this practice, we reach a state of unwavering stability, where we are no longer tossed and turned by the waves of sensory experience. This state is not temporary but permanent, a testament to the profound inner transformation that*pratyāhāra* facilitates.

**Abhyāsa and Anabhyāsa**:

The text differentiates between *abhyāsa* (practice) and *anabhyāsa* (lack of practice) in the context of *pratyāhāra*. As long as we identifywith the body and mind, we need constant effort and repetition (*abhyāsa*) to maintain a state of inner stillness. However, true *pratyāhāra* leads to a state of *sāman* (equanimity, balance), where the need for constant effort falls away, and we rest effortlesslyin our true nature.

**Tanmayi and the Four Samādhis**:

The discussion of *pratyāhāra* concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the concept of *tanmayi* and the four kinds of *samādhi* to gain a deeper comprehension of this advanced yogic practice andits role in attaining higher states of consciousness.

In conclusion, *pratyāhāra* is not merely a technique for sensory withdrawal but a profound inner journey that leads to liberation from the clutches of the external world and the realization of our true, unbounded nature.

### Concluding Śloka: Invoking Grace onthe Path of Realization

The session culminates in the chanting of a potent *śloka* dedicated to Lord Shiva, encapsulating the essence of the yogic path and invoking divine grace for the realization of the ultimate truth.

**Namaḥ Śivāya: Salutations to the Supreme Consciousness**:

The*śloka* begins with "Namaḥ Śivāya" – salutations to Lord Shiva. In yogic philosophy, Shiva represents pure consciousness, the unchanging reality that underlies the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. He is the destroyer of illusion, the liberator from the cycle of birth and death.

**Pañcākriyā Vibhāgine: The Lord of Five Actions**:

Shiva is also revered as "Pañcākriyā Vibhāgine" – the Lord of the five actions: creation, preservation, dissolution, concealment, and grace. These five actions represent the dynamic interplay of forcesthat govern the universe, and Shiva, as the supreme consciousness, orchestrates this cosmic dance.

**Cidānandākāraṇasvātmā: The Essence of Bliss and the Source of All**:

The *śloka* describes Shiva as "Cidānandākāraṇasvātmā"– whose true nature is pure consciousness (cit), bliss (ānanda), and the cause of everything (kāraṇa). This points to the ultimate reality that yogis strive to realize – a state of pure awareness, infinite bliss, and the understanding that all things arise from and dissolve back into this supreme consciousness.**Paramārthavijñāne: Bestowing the Knowledge of Ultimate Reality**:

Finally, the *śloka* concludes with "Paramārthavijñāne" – to the one who bestows the knowledge of the ultimate reality (paramārtha). This highlights the importance ofgrace in the yogic journey. While personal effort is essential, the realization of the ultimate truth ultimately comes through divine grace, the awakening of wisdom from within.

**The Power of Repetition**:

The repetition of this *śloka* serves as a powerful reminder of the ultimate goal of yoga – the realization ofour true nature and the awakening to the divine reality that permeates all things. Each repetition is a step towards that realization, a surrender to the divine will, and an invitation for grace to guide us on our journey.

**Concluding with Gratitude and Aspiration**:

The session ends with a heartfelt "Namaste" –a recognition of the divine spark within each of us – and a brief mention of *manas vibhaya* (fear of the mind), suggesting a continued exploration of the mind's complexities and the practices to overcome its limitations. 

This comprehensive exploration of *āsana*, *prāṇāyāma*, *pratyāhāra*, and the concluding *śloka* unveils the profound depth and transformative power of these yogic practices. It is a journey inward, a dive into the depths of our being, where we connect with the subtlest vibrations of life force, transcend the limitations of the mind and senses, andultimately realize our true nature as pure consciousness, bliss, and infinite potential.
